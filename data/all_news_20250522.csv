What would Russias peace deal demands really mean for Ukraine?  visualised,"Trump on Monday again failed to persuade Putin to accept a ceasefire in Ukraine as a first step toward a peace deal. But what might a deal even look like, and what would it mean for the Ukrainian people?One of the few explicit peace proposals is a US outline reportedly seen by Reuters last month. It asks Ukraine to accept de jure recognition of Russias annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of its occupation of large parts of several oblasts in the countrys east. On Monday, Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that Russia is demanding Ukrainian troops abandon five oblasts as a precondition not for peace, but for a ceasefire and the opening of negotiations.Before the war, those oblasts were home to about 11 million Ukrainians. To put that into context, we visualised some broadly comparable populated areas in three European countries and one US state, in each case starting from the north-east corner. The shaded areas represent populations of about 11 million French, British, Italian and US citizens.

Breath-stoppingly tense which Mission Impossible film is the greatest?,"As The Final Reckoning hits cinemas, Guardian writers pick their favourites of the action-packed seriesMission Impossibles slick and sensuous surface bears no trace of the drama behind the scenes making it. During production, the screenwriters of Jurassic Park David Koepp and Chinatown Robert Towne sent in duelling script pages for director Brian De Palma and producer Tom Cruise to wrestle over. The magnificent outcome is an intense tango between the modern blockbuster and a classic film noir, circling each other warily, and beautifully, like no Mission Impossible that would follow. De Palmas original is a sexy wrong-man thriller, a Hitchcockian affair that comes disguised as an action-heavy corporate product or maybe the mask is worn the other way around?. In it, Cruises coiled IMF agent, framed for the murder of his entire team and surrounded by slippery allies, is constantly trying to play it cool through the plots knotty parlor games, all while feeling the noose tightening around him. If Cruises career up to this point was all about often leaving his relaxed boyish middle-American charm on the surface, Mission Impossible pushed him to try on layers  not just the latex ones  while also pulling off those incredible high-wire stunts, which would only escalate but never improve on the hair-raising tension the first time out.

A few years ago, they say, the market would have been bustling with ice-cream sellers, salt vendors and horse-drawn carts delivering freshly caught fish to the women, who would set about sun-drying, salting and sorting the catch into affordable portions for local families to buy.Today, trade is dead, says Aissatou Wade, one of the remaining small-scale fish processors left in the town.

HighPriest1967Paul is an extraordinary director, a visionary director, and I absorbed so much by watching him work. He comes from documentary, so even though he was filming these elaborate, very expensive, complicated action sequences, he was still able to see things happening spontaneously. I remember when we were shooting The Bourne Ultimatum in Tangier, running through those windy streets. Normally as an actor, you turn a corner and you think youre off camera, so youd stop. But you could never do that with Paul because there might be a camera around the corner. He always liked to keep us on our toes.You stole the show as Heather Grahams sister in Chosen Family. Is it easier to approach comedic, unpredictable roles as opposed to more intense, serious, Bourne-like performances? BicuserI absolutely love working on comedies.

The Crucible review  Millers resonant tale of terror given radical sense of humour,"Shakespeares Globe, LondonDirector Ola Ince brings absurdist comedy to Arthur Millers classic drama of Salem witch-hunting, now told partly through songThere is never a time when Arthur Millers play about a world turned upside down by collective hysteria and scapegoating does not bear some resonance. But the present moment  of dangerously disputed truths and lies  is an especially pertinent moment to revisit Millers analogy between accusations of witchcraft and McCarthyist terror.This production is faithful to the original 17th-century setting, amid the heat and panic of the Salem witch trials. There is period dress bonnets for women, pointed hats for men and ribbons for the judges, along with a range of broad British accents for these original American pilgrims. But director Ola Ince brings a quietly radical touch in the form of humour  more absurdist than comic, with accusations of flying girls and demon possession taking on preposterous tones. The men, mostly the judges of the last two acts, appear bumbling, like yokels arguing over the fate of their chattel at a country fair. Deputy Governor Danforth Gareth Snook is particularly clownish, though no less awful for it.

Two days earlier he had, at the age of 39, scored a winner for the ages at Wembley and sent his boyhood club to the Premier League. He could not have caught the ball any more sweetly after Fraizer Campbell had chipped it across it was no hardship that, even then, he knew it would follow him for ever.It changed my life, Windass says, sitting in his living room on a quiet May morning. I scored 234 goals and everyone only talks about that one. To this day he swears a scorcher at Wycombe in 1992-93, volleyed in with my left foot from 950 million yards, was superior to his museum piece from 2008.

Extremely loud and incredibly scouse how Jamie Carragher conquered football punditry,"Football coverage no longer stops after the final whistle. And in this new era, the former Liverpool defender reigns supremeJamie Carraghers legs were aching. He had been speaking to a Sky Sports cameraman for 25 minutes. Usually for a news interview its just 10, but today called for something more. Reports were coming out that Trent Alexander-Arnold, who inherited Carraghers mantle as the local mainstay of Liverpools defence, was about to announce his long-expected departure from his boyhood club, and so, as sure as day follows night, a camera crew had been hastily dispatched to Carraghers whereabouts to find a quiet spot, hit record and get his opinions out to viewers before theyd had a chance to fully form their own.How much was there to say about a subject that had already been talked about all season long? Quite a lot, it turned out. Like a hunter-gatherer extracting a weeks worth of food from a seemingly arid wilderness, Carragher  occasionally prompted by a Sky Sports anchor in the studio  launched into nearly half an hour of pure, free-flowing, agenda-setting football opinionating. From this monologue, Sky would carve out a TV report, YouTube interview, news article and three short-form videos. When Carragher says something  about Alexander-Arnolds future, Arsenals attack, Chelseas owners or Fifas executives  we tend to hear about it very shortly after.

Now that Gaza is flattened, turned into mass graves and rubble, people who have kept quiet for the past 19 months are slowly starting to speak up.

After 19 months of genocidal violence and almost three months of a starvation campaign the UK has decided to describe the situation as egregious.

Ive studied the history of death. I know how we can better face up to our grief  and our own mortality  Molly Conisbee,"How we deal with bereavement has changed enormously over the years. But not all the old traditions should be forgottenMany years ago, as part of a school homework project, I asked my grandparents what the most significant social change had been during their lifetime. Two of them answered child mortality. I was surprised. Werent there other, more significant experiences in long lives that had stretched from the first and second world wars to the 1980s?But now that I am older and have experienced bereavement, I understand their replies. Both grandparents had sisters who died of diphtheria. And my grandfathers younger brother died of sepsis, meaning his parents had buried two of their four children before the age of three. Their childhoods had been profoundly shaped by loss. Child mortality was, at that time, horrifyingly common, and from their earliest years many people spent a great deal of their lives coping with the emotional fallout of grief, which shaped their lives into older age.Molly Conisbee is a social historian, visiting research fellow at the Centre for Death and Society at the University of Bath, and author of No Ordinary Deaths Continue reading...",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/22/i-have-studied-history-of-death-better-face-grief-mortality,2025-05-22T09:00:00,The Guardian,UK,en

This was after the international court of justice found Israels occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and demanded it end its occupation as rapidly as possible and provide full reparations to Palestinians.Israels increased violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory also comes after it denied all food, water and supplies from entering Gaza for over 75 days.

The Guardian view on Russia sanctions a brittle economy is Putins weakness  Editorial,"Ukraines allies must dial up sanctions to expose the fragility of the Kremlins strategy for perpetual warDonald Trumps pledge to end the war in Ukraine on the first day of his second term as US president was a sign of his unsuitability as a peace broker. A clearer sign was his apparent sympathy with Vladimir Putin. Mr Trumps tone regarding the Russian president has cooled somewhat on the discovery that the conflict cannot be frozen by White House diktat. There are hints of recognition that the peace process is failing because the Kremlin is cynically playing for time. Sadly, any such insight hasnt evolved into outrage at the criminal aggression that started the war in the first place.Accounts of a telephone call between the two leaders earlier this week indicate no increase in American pressure on Russia.

I struggled with the lifestyle former teen prodigy Amanda Anisimova on her career-saving break,"As she returns to the French Open, where she broke through in a run to the 2019 semis, the American explains why she stepped away from the sportProfessional tennis players are often led to believe that taking time off is fatal. In such an intense, competitive individual sport where greatness is determined though fine margins, the pressure to keep on moving is eternal. If you are not constantly training, competing and working on your craft, it is said, someone will always be there to take your place. Once you lose your spot, you may never get it back.During the most difficult period of her career, Amanda Anisimova, a former teen prodigy, had to reckon with that myth. In the depths of her depression, when the intensity of the tennis circuit had become unbearable and her mind was screaming out for change, the 23-year-old opted for the solution of a complete break from the sport two years ago.

Even in their worst season, Barcelona are going for a second quadruple in a row and third consecutive Womens Champions League title. Few may have predicted that late last year, after a defeat at Manchester City prompted a new narrative this was the season they were finally not going to win anything.In the end, they won the Liga F title but only after losing twice. That may not sound terrible but it is the first time since the 2018-19 season they have been defeated more than once in the league. So a crisis of some sort. The loss at City also prompted some soul-searching for a team in their first season with a new manager, Pere Romeu replacing Jonatan Giráldez last summer.

Im less apologetic now Kelly Macdonald on her Trainspotting teen highs and hitting her stride in her 40s,"She hid in the toilets during the Trainspotting shoot  yet became a screen sensation. As the star plays a police therapist in new Netflix thriller Dept Q, she explains why todays young female actors leave her in aweOne of the good things about playing a therapist, says Kelly Macdonald with a laugh, is that you get to sit down a lot. Theres a fun scene in the new Netflix thriller Dept. Q in which her character, Dr Rachel Irving, weary of her client DCI Carl Morck, plants herself down behind her desk to eat her packed lunch in front of him. Morck may be the kind of troubled detective were used to seeing in police dramas, but Irving isnt a typical therapist. Shes blunt, antagonistic even. Its a shitty job working with police officers, she tells him. Another time she describes him as doolally, which in my experience is not something a typical therapist would say Macdonald, who has had therapy, but not regularly, may agree.In the show  adapted from novels by the Danish author Jussi Adler-Olsen and brought to the screen by Scott Frank, who was also behind the Netflix hit The Queens Gambit  Morck is made to see Irving after he survives a shooting. Brilliant but sidelined, Morck is tasked with reviewing cold cases, and moved to a shabby basement office that becomes known as Department Q. The first case for his small crew of misfit detectives is the disappearance of a lawyer four years earlier, who everyone thinks is probably dead. The truth, it soon emerges, is absolutely terrifying.

With icy provocation, Israels ruling classes are presented as decadent and indifferent to the slaughter and suffering of Gaza. But the film is also in some ways a sympathetic study of a people haunted by the antisemitic butchery of 7 October.It is inspired by the activist group Civic Front, which after 7 October released a new version of Haim Gouris classic song Hareut, or Fellowship, with jarring new lyrics calling for wholesale extermination in Gaza. A fictional version of this song features here, with lyrics about attacking the bearers of the swastika as in the original but also presents its audience with slick equivalence the Nazi gotcha-comparison is levelled at Israel in a way that it isnt at other countries. There is an odious Russian fintech bro here, commissioning jingoistic, nationalistic music the suggested equivalence between Putin and Israel is presented without subtlety, although subtlety is maybe beside the point.

Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No 3 album review  hear the performance that made Yunchan Lim a star,"Yunchan LimFort Worth SOAlsopDeccaThe prodigious South Korean talent won 2022s Van Cliburn piano competition with this performance his version deserves a place alongside Argerich and Rachmaninov himselfAs soon as the 2022 Van Cliburn piano competition in Fort Worth, Texas, was over, news travelled across the Atlantic that the latest winner was very special indeed. Over the following year or so, Yunchan Lims recitals in Europe and a first disc for Decca of the Chopin Études, together with recordings that documented his performances in the competition, of Liszts Transcendental Études in his semi-final recital, and Rachmaninovs Third Concerto in the final, confirmed that the reports had been no exaggeration he is the real thing, a once-in-a-generation talent. Now Decca has reissued the Fort Worth concerto performance, but with the sound significantly cleaned up and rebalanced, and the wonder of Lims playing if anything enhanced. What is immediately striking is the sheer confidence and poise of everything he does, and the overriding sense that there is never any doubt about the direction in which this majestic concerto should be taken its hard to believe that this is the performance of an 18-year-old.Needless to say, every technical challenge in the keyboard writing seems to be effortlessly negotiated, yet the brilliance is never an end in itself it is always part of a bigger picture, without ever diminishing the thrill of such astonishing command, so that the way the unadorned melodic lines of the slow movement are phrased becomes just as telling as the way in which the densest flurries of notes are negotiated. Just perhaps in the finale, when Lim can seem too headstrong for his own good, does his performance betray his age otherwise it deserves a place alongside the finest versions of this concerto on disc, from those by Rachmaninov himself and Vladimir Horowitz to Martha Argerich and Vladimir Ashkenazy.

No Straight Road Takes You There by Rebecca Solnit review  an activists antidote to despair,"Hope is no casual platitude in this inspiring collection of essays its the realistic mindset with which to approach existential challengesAccording to Rebecca Solnit, a lot of us are suffering from something called moral injury. She describes this as the deep sense of wrongness that can infiltrate our lives when we realise we are complicit in something seriously bad.The first time I experienced this in relation to climate change, I was changing my babys nappy soon after one of the worst Australian wildfire seasons on record in 2020. The nappy featured a smiling cartoon koala on the front. I immediately recalled the scene of a singed, parched koala being fed water from a plastic bottle by a human as it fled the inferno. A disposable nappy takes up to 500 years to decompose. I felt disgust and despair at the degree of consumption, waste and exploitation that even a modest lifestyle in a high-income country seems to entail.

Things in Nature Merely Grow by Yiyun Li review  a shattering account of losing two sons,"The novelists meditation on grief, memory and radical acceptance contains both horror and comfortIn this quietly devastating account of life after the death by suicide of both of her sons, Yiyun Li refuses to use mourning or grieving because they cannot adequately contain the magnitude of her experience. My husband and I had two children and lost them both, she writes, and words can only fall short.She begins by laying out the facts. And those facts, raw and precise, are shattering Vincent died in 2017, aged 16. James died in 2024, aged 19. Vincent, we learn, loved baking and knitting, and did not live long enough to graduate high school. James, a brilliant linguist studying at Princeton, where Li teaches creative writing, took his last Japanese class on a Friday. Facts, with their logic, meaning, and weight, are what I hold on to, she writes. Things in Nature Merely Grow is by necessity profoundly sad, but in the act of sharing details of the abyss she now inhabits, Li has created something both inclusive and humane.

The Book of Guilt by Catherine Chidgey review  this dystopia could have been extraordinary,"Alternate political realities are compellingly explored in this sinister vision of a childrens home  but the echoes of Ishiguro are just too strongIn 2016 Catherine Chidgey published her fourth novel, The Wish Child, a childs-eye view of Nazi Germany. Since then the much-garlanded New Zealander has contrived to be not only conspicuously prolific but also intriguingly unpredictable. Though she returned to wartime Germany in her Womens prize-longlisted Holocaust novel, Remote Sympathy, her work has ranged from the coming-of-age psychological thriller Pet to The Beat of the Pendulum, a found novel that drew on everything from conversations and social media posts to news bulletins and even satnav instructions to create a picture of one womans life over a year. The Axemans Carnival, published in the UK last year, was partly narrated by a magpie. Like The Wish Child it won the Acorn prize for fiction, making Chidgey the only writer to win New Zealands most prestigious prize twice.The Book of Guilt appears to mark another departure. Chidgey describes her ninth novel as her first foray into dystopian fiction and, while the book purports to be set in England in 1979 with a female prime minister newly ensconced in Downing Street, it is not the country we know. In Chidgeys alternate universe, the second world war ended not in 1945 with allied victory, but in 1943 when the assassination of Hitler by German conspirators led to a swiftly negotiated peace treaty. Subsequent collaboration across Europe has ensured that progress in biological and medical science, already significantly advanced, has accelerated, fuelled by shared research that includes the grotesque experiments carried out on prisoners in Nazi death camps.

There would be some tantalising new machine out before you knew it, everybody competing to be on the cutting edge the Game Boy and Sega GenesisMega Drive in 1989 were followed by the Game Gear in 1990 and the Super NES in 1991. Five years was a long life for a gaming machine.Now, its more like 10. The Nintendo Switch 2 will be released in a couple of weeks, more than eight years since I first picked an original Switch up off its dock and marvelled at the instant transition to portable play. Games consoles often feel like they mark off particular eras in my life the Nintendo 64 was the defining console of my childhood, the PlayStation 2 of my adolescence, and the Xbox 360 of the first years of my career, the first console launch I ever covered as a ridiculously young journalist.

Deliver at All Costs review  madcap driving game goes nowhere fast,"PC, Xbox, PS5 version played Studio Far Out GamesKonami Digital EntertainmentThis 1950s-set game offers a gorgeous, fully destroyable map but makes baffling decisions on how to use itDeliver at All Costs casts you as a delivery driver in the late 1950s, and it looks fantastic in motion. Almost everything on the map can be destroyed, and there is immediate fun to be had from causing merry mayhem with your truck, clattering through deckchairs on the beach or driving straight through the middle of a diner and watching it collapse spectacularly behind you. But there is a void at the heart of this game where the core hook should have been.We get a glimpse of its potential during a mission that sees you racing to catch up with a rivals delivery truck before it can reach its destination. The aim is to manoeuvre alongside, and hold down a button so the crane on the back of your own truck can sneakily lift the package off their vehicle and on to yours. All the while, rival trucks are attempting to ram you off the road, and after you grab the package, you then have to deliver it while fending off the attentions of these other drivers. It leads to some wonderfully comic scenes in which a hotel owner thanks you profusely for a consignment while standing in front of the ruins of his newly destroyed establishment a casualty of the violent act of delivery.

Farm Simulator 16bit Edition review  the simple joy of ploughing your own furrow,"Strictly LimitedGiants Software Mega Drive It may be seem horrendously old-fashioned, but the seemingly dull repetition of working your wheat fields has a nostalgic pull like a combine harvesterWhen I got my first job in games journalism 30 years ago, I arrived just too late to review games for my favourite ever console the Sega Mega Drive. Although a few titles were still being released for the machine in 1995, the games magazine world had moved on and all anyone wanted to read about were the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It was a bitter blow.Fast-forward to 2025 and a resurgent interest in producing new games for vintage home computers and consoles has led to Farming Simulator 16bit Edition  a Mega Drive instalment in the hugely successful agricultural sim series. The passion project of Renzo Thönen, lead level designer and co-owner of Farming Simulation studio Giants Software, the game has been written using an open-source Mega Drive development kit, and manufactured in a limited run of genuine Mega Drive cartridges. Slotting this brand new release into the cart of my dads ancient Mega Drive II console felt ridiculously moving and I thought the game could only be a letdown after that. But I was wrong.

"Hockney in London review  hip, horny but still searching for his own style","Hazlitt Holland-Hibbert, LondonBefore he made a bigger splash, David Hockney was an angry, tempestuous student mashing together the styles of the big artists of his timeYears before he was a modern art megastar, long before the cool pop perfection that would make him one of the most popular painters of the past century, David Hockney was a student. Some of his early works from this period have been brought together at a small but perfectly formed exhibition, curated by Louis Kasmin, grandson of John Kasmin, the dealer who first spotted Hockney.After leaving the Bradford School of Art, Hockney showed up at the RCA in 1959 ready to kick the art worlds doors in. But this is not the Hockney the world knows now. There is no simplicity, no calm. There are no cool, flat planes of bright colour. Rather, young Hockney was a frantic, angry, tempestuous thing.

Anyone fancy a subwoofer massage? The show that shakes you senseless,"From vibrating stages and a car park dance floor to metal pipes tuned to the frequency of love, the artists behind a new exhibition say their work may even change your body on a cellular levelYou know, 528Hz is supposed to be the love frequency, says artist Evan Ifekoya, striking a metal wah-wah pipe tuned to exactly that pitch, a fraction above the C, one octave higher than middle C. Its supposed to be able to transform the body on a cellular level. And, OK, how can you really prove that? they smile. But I can say, at least for myself, it has opened up a new level of awareness and self-compassion over the years. We know music is powerful we turn to songs to feel comforted, to boost our energy, to appreciate beauty and so much more. But what about the frequencies the actual soundwaves vibrating the air, our eardrums and our bodies  how do they affect us? From promoting deep relaxation to the use of noise as a weapon, there is a wide range of claims, and evidence, for the impact of sound. It moves us emotionally and literally, a theme thats explored in a new exhibition at the Barbican in London called Feel the Sound. The idea that the world is made up of vibrations and frequencies is something we dont necessarily think about a lot of the time, says Luke Kemp, head of creative programming at Barbican Immersive. The big idea is how sound is more than an audio experience. We can think of our whole body as a listening device, he says.Take Jan St Werners Vibraceptional Plate installation, which visitors can stand on and then explore the resonance of their own body, and a film by deaf percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie discussing the rhythms inside us and how she experiences sound. Theres a holographic choral experience, a playground of multisensory musical instruments, and for the finale, an installation in the Barbicans car park featuring souped-up cars with big sound systems part sculpture, part dancefloor.

Brought to life in a bestselling memoir written with Basque poet Amets Arzallus Antia, it follows his trek from Guinea, west Africa, as a teenager, across the Sahara and Mediterranean to Europe as he goes in desperate search of his runaway younger brother.A story about the horrors of migration, it has so many gut-punch moments alongside flashes of levity that it should make for dramatic viewing on stage.

Shucked review  terrific songs add zest to undercooked corn country musical,"Regents Park Open Air theatre, London Thin tale of neighbourly spirit is loaded with groansome gags but the hoedowns and show tunes are full of flavourAw, shucks. Theres plenty to love about this US import, a country musical with a zany corn obsession and a message about breaking down barriers that suits this open air theatre. But just how much corn-fed wordplay can you stomach? Youll soon find out. Theres a maze of maize jokes, some kernels of truth amid the cornball sentiment, a husk of a plot about a corn doctor mistakenly assumed to treat ears not feet and a few painful gags about cornholes. The actors essentially double as standups, delivering one-liners that are often very funny and occasionally enhance character and story but are mostly fired at random as if punslinger Tim Vine had been cloned and let loose.Were in Cob County where Maizy Im afraid so is about to wed Beau. When the small towns valuable corn crop fails, she journeys to Tampa, Florida, for answers and meets conman Gordy who has two dubious claims  one on her heart and one that he can save the beleaguered town.

The closest thing to a grand opera Ill ever write, says the Whos guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend. Set in 1965, the story of disaffected young mod Jimmy looking for meaning in life via music, amphetamines and aspirational tailoring became a cult 1979 film starring Phil Daniels, but a more recent incarnation was Classic Quadrophenia, a symphonic version of the album for orchestra and tenor Alfie Boe.

Customers are very likely to have spotted the millefoglie long before seeing it typed up on the paper menu, though, because it will be sitting near the front door, either on the dessert trolley or zinc bar.Named because the concertina puff of the pastry looks like a thousand mille leaves foglie, La Torricella prepares a millefoglie that is more or less the size of a vinyl LP, its three rings of pastry sandwiched with a mixture of custard and whipped cream, otherwise known as diplomat cream. The layers of preparation make it a special-occasion dessert  in fact, La Torricella makes millefoglie only when a large enough group requests one.

How to turn the dregs of a tahini jar into a brilliant Japanese condiment - recipe  Waste not,"Use up those final scrapings to make goma dare, a versatile sesame dipping sauce that adds a kick of flavour to salads and soupsA jar of goma dare is a new favourite fixture in my fridge door. This Japanese-style condiment, dipping sauce and dressing made from ground sesame seeds is powerful in flavour, sweet, sour and creamy all at the same time, while the addition of grated ginger andor garlic makes it wonderfully piquant, too. Its also very moreish and hugely versatile, meaning you can serve it with everything from a traditional shabu shabu hot pot to cold noodles, tofu, aubergine and slaw in fact, its so tasty I have to stop myself from eating it straight from the jar. My recipe uses the leftover tahini in the bottom of a jar and comes together in the jar itself, so minimising both waste and washing-up. Simply add all the ingredients, scrape down the sides and shake you can apply a similar method to the ends of a peanut butter jar, too, for a nutty, satay-style twist.

I click with my new man on every level  except he doesnt want to have sex,"The medication hes on reduces his libido and means he cant take erectile dysfunction products. But Im a very sensual person  what can I do?I started dating someone I really like about two months ago. We click on all levels and he adores me, but he has some complicated circumstances, which means we have no sex life. He has anxiety and takes SSRIs, which reduce his libido. He also takes blood thinners for a coronary issue, which I know precludes the use of erectile dysfunction products.

Im taking beta blockers for my anxiety  and so are many of my friends. Is that a problem?,"Dreading the thought of giving a speech, or stressed about a big work event? Your GP may prescribe beta blockers to reduce the effects of adrenaline on your heart. Heres what happened when I took themI first took beta blockers two years ago, when I was asked to give a eulogy. Terrible at public speaking on a good day, let alone at a funeral, my first instinct was to refuse to do it. I had made a speech at a friends wedding 15 years before and my legs shook so violently throughout that I thought I would collapse. This isnt a case of being overcritical or dramatic I find it almost impossible to stand up in front of a crowd and talk. It is an ordeal, for all involved  or it was before I took beta blockers.Beta blockers are a prescription medication that blocks adrenaline and therefore temporarily reduces the bodys reaction to stress. Routinely given to patients with heart and circulatory conditions, including angina, atrial fibrillation and high blood pressure, as well as to prevent migraines, they are also prescribed for some kinds of anxiety. Some doctors will suggest taking them regularly, at certain times of the day. Others will suggest taking a specified dose when you feel you need it. They work by reducing the effects of adrenaline on the heart, so you dont get that heart-racing feeling, you may not get short of breath or sweaty, and they can reduce the symptoms of a full-blown panic attack, says doctor and broadcaster Amir Khan, who has been a GP in Bradford for 16 years.

They resonate on different frequencies, in a subtle sort of a way. They are not exactly opposites, but they are not interchangeable either. Not chalk and cheese, but perhaps a bit like salt-and-vinegar and cheese-and-onion. Just different flavours.A stripe is brisker, while a spot is giving whimsy.

Sali Hughes on beauty Feeling the heat? Avoid summer meltdowns with new long-wear makeup,"Thanks to excellent new tints, sticks and sprays, rising temperatures do not have to mean melting makeupAt the time of writing, my life and mood have been shifted dramatically by spring sunshine. And so too would my makeup if I hadnt spent weeks testing new long-wear products designed to stop ones face melting in the heat. Those of us with oily skin, an active lifestyle or a hormonal propensity for sweating or flushing, can also struggle to hold on to foundation, eyeshadow and more. But until recently, the term long-wear often meant dry, dragging, somewhat joyless textures and shades.My best new discovery is Milks superlative Hydro Grip Gel Tint 34, available in 15 shades I wear number five and its perfect. Its light and comfortable texture and sheer, natural-looking, summery coverage betray what is extraordinarily dogged staying power. Used in place of foundation or tinted moisturiser, this has remained perfectly intact through tears, 16-hour days and a common cold  its glow never dimming. It has a flexible, stretchy gel texture that prevents cracking or caking as skin tires and dries. Concealer, blush, powders and anything else you care to throw on top layer over happily and smoothly it has a similar texture to a primer. Its an unequivocal 1010 and I already know itll be among my best products of 2025. For a smidge more coverage with a comparable lifespan, try Maybellines impressive Super Stay 24h Skin Tint 13.99.

A moment that changed me I thought Id never fit in in rural France  until a revelation at the boulangerie,"Id spent 10 years trying to be more like my goat-farming neighbours. What if I stressed my Britishness instead?I was standing in the long queue of a rural French boulangerie when it happened. The sun was just coming up and the glorious smell of freshly baked baguette filled the dawn air. I drank it in and shuffled forward, awaiting my turn, aware I was getting looks  and it wasnt difficult to see why. I had driven all night from performing at a comedy gig in London to get to my home in the Loire valley, and I was still in my work clothes. My stage wear included a check tweed Edwardian frock coat with matching weskit, navy blue dress trousers, brogue monk shoes, a smart Oxford-collared shirt and a knitted blue tie, slightly loosened. Under normal circumstances, I would not invade my local boulangerie dressed as a cross between a late 60s dandy and a roaring 20s duellist, but it had been a long drive, and I was too tired to tone it down.Plus, I had never really fit in locally anyway. We had moved there about 10 years earlier, in 2005  a catastrophic decision, according to my agent, but a happy one for me, my wife and our then four-year-old son the pace of life was less frenetic and we felt less hemmed in. And, as I often said only half-jokingly, it was the closest place to London we could afford to buy a house.

Trump confronts South African leader with baseless claims of the systematic killing of white farmers,"WASHINGTON  President Donald Trump used a White House meeting to forcefully confront South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, accusing the country of failing to address Trumps baseless claim of the systematic killing of white farmers. Trump even dimmed the lights of the Oval Office to play a video of a far-left politician chanting a song that includes the lyrics kill the farmer. He also leafed through news articles to underscore his point, saying the countrys white farmers have faced death, death, death, horrible death. Trump had already cut all U.S. assistance to South Africa and welcomed several dozen white South African farmers to the U.S. as refugees as he pressed the case that a genocide is underway in the country . The U.S. president, since his return to office, has launched a series of accusations at South Africas Black-led government, claiming it is seizing land from white farmers, enforcing antiwhite policies and pursuing an anti-American foreign policy . Experts in South Africa say there is no evidence of whites being targeted for their race, although",https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/world/20250522/trump-confronts-south-african-leader-with-baseless-claims-of-the-systematic-killing-of-white-farmers?utm_source=rss,2025-05-22T14:47:03,Korea Times,South Korea,en
Netanyahu promises new Gaza aid delivery plan as supplies still fail to reach Palestinians,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip  The U.N. said Wednesday it was trying to get the desperately needed aid that has entered Gaza this week into the hands of Palestinians amid delays because of fears of looting and Israeli military restrictions. Israeli strikes pounded the territory, killing at least 86 people, according to Gazas Health Ministry. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the country is days away from implementing a new aid system in Gaza that has come under heavy international criticism. He said Israel later plans to create a sterile zone there, free of Hamas, where the population, which has repeatedly evacuated and relocated throughout the war, would be moved and receive supplies. With renewed ceasefire talks appearing to make little progress, Netanyahu said he will end the war only if Hamas releases all hostages and steps down from power  and if President Donald Trumps plan to relocate the territorys population outside Gaza is implemented. The Palestinians, along with nearly all of the international community, have rejected Trumps plan to",https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/world/20250522/netanyahu-promises-new-gaza-aid-delivery-plan-as-supplies-still-fail-to-reach-palestinians?utm_source=rss,2025-05-22T14:47:03,Korea Times,South Korea,en

Dia da Chardonnay 5 vinhos elegantes da Argentina,"Saiba tudo sobre essa nobre uva branca e descubra rótulos imperdíveis. A Chardonnay é uma das variedades de uva mais populares e amplamente cultivadas no mundo, reconhecida por sua versatilidade e capacidade de refletir diferentes terroirs. Seus aromas variam de notas cítricas, maçã verde e pêssego, a nuances de manteiga, baunilha e toques amanteigados, especialmente quando passa por fermentação em barril. No paladar, o vinho pode ser fresco e leve ou encorpado e untuoso, dependendo do método de vinificação, o que faz dele uma escolha bastante democrática para diferentes estilos de consumo. A Chardonnay é cultivada em climas variados, o que influencia diretamente suas características. Na França, especialmente na Borgonha, é conhecida por produzir vinhos elegantes, com notas minerais e complexidade aromática. Nos Estados Unidos, na Califórnia, a variedade tende a ser mais frutada e encorpada, com destaque para sabores de frutas tropicais e baunilha. Na Austrália, o estilo dos vinhos varia de fresco a mais robusto, enquanto na Itália, especialmente na região do Friuli, o Chardonnay apresenta uma mineralidade marcante. A Argentina, por sua vez, tem se destacado na produção de Chardonnay de alta qualidade, especialmente nas regiões de Mendoza, Salta e Patagônia. Os vinhos argentinos costumam apresentar um equilíbrio interessante entre frescor e complexidade, com aromas de frutas cítricas, maçã, pera e notas de baunilha, resultado do uso de barris de carvalho em alguns casos. A altitude elevada das vinícolas argentinas contribui para uma acidez vibrante, que confere ao vinho uma estrutura elegante. Além disso, a diversidade de climas e solos argentinos permite a produção de Chardonnays com diferentes perfis, atendendo tanto aos apreciadores de vinhos mais leves quanto aos que preferem versões mais complexas. Com sua adaptabilidade e riqueza de aromas, o Chardonnay continua conquistando paladares ao redor do mundo, e a produção argentina vem ganhando destaque por oferecer opções de alta qualidade, que unem tradição e inovação.

PT não consegue urnas eletrônicas e terá voto impresso em eleições internas,"Partido pediu equipamentos à Justiça Eleitoral, mas nem todos os tribunais regionais aceitaram emprestar urnas. Novo presidente da sigla será escolhido em 6 de julho ex-ministro Edinho Silva é tido como favorito. A executiva nacional do PT decidiu nesta quarta-feira 21 que as eleições internas da sigla, marcadas para o dia 6 de julho, serão realizadas em cédula de papel. A decisão foi tomada após a legenda não conseguir que a Justiça Eleitoral emprestasse urnas eletrônicas para o processo. O PT havia consultado o Tribunal Superior Eleitoral TSE sobre a possibilidade, mas foi informado pelo órgão de que a decisão sobre o empréstimo cabia aos Tribunais Regionais Eleitorais TREs. O partido defendia o uso das urnas no processo interno por avaliar que os equipamentos são mais seguros e confiáveis, além de agilizar a divulgação de resultados. Segundo informações de dirigentes do partido, apenas parte dos 27 TREs concordou em emprestar os equipamentos. Sem uma decisão unificada da Justiça Eleitoral, e para evitar que estados tivessem processos eleitorais diferentes, a sigla optou por definir que o pleito será inteiramente feito em cédulas. Como o TSE não consegue fornecer urnas eletrônicas em todos estados e cidades onde haverá votação, chegamos à conclusão de que é melhor fazer com cédulas para ficar igual no Brasil inteiro. Faremos como no último PED Processo de Eleição Direta, afirmou ao g1 o secretário-geral do partido, Henrique Fontana. Edinho Silva critica reunião na casa de Gleisi sobre sucessão no PT O PT se prepara para renovar as direções da sigla em todo o país. As eleições serão diretas  isto é, os filiados poderão votar diretamente para escolher os novos comandantes. As cédulas de votação serão produzidas pelo próprio partido, e a contagem dos votos será manual. No cenário nacional, o ex-prefeito de Araraquara Edinho Silva é o favorito para conquistar a presidência do partido. Edinho conseguiu reunir apoio unificado da maior corrente interna da sigla e do presidente Lula. Aliados estimam que ele terá votos suficientes para se eleger em primeiro turno. Além dele, outros quatro nomes se candidataram para disputar o comando nacional do partido Rui Falcão Romênio Pereira Valter Pomar e Dani Nunes. O presidente eleito tomará posse no encontro nacional do PT, que ocorrerá nos primeiros dias de agosto. O mandato será de quatro anos.

Motorista sem CNH é indiciado por atropelar e matar mulher e filho dela no Dia das Mães com carro a 97 kmh,"Velocidade máxima permitida na via era de 40 kmh. Ele vai responder por homicídio doloso, quando se assume o risco de matar. Mãe e filho morrem atropelados após motorista sem CNH perder controle de carro A Polícia Civil indiciou o motorista que atropelou e matou uma mulher e o filho dela, no Dia das Mães, em Santa Luzia, por homicídio doloso  quando se assume o risco de matar. Em coletiva de imprensa realizada nesta quinta-feira 22, o delegado Fábio Lucas Gabrich Cruz e Silva disse que o carro estava a 97 kmh, sendo que o limite da via era de 40 kmh. RELEMBRE Mãe e filho morrem atropelados após motorista sem CNH perder controle de carro Inicialmente, Anestor Santos Carvalho seria indiciado por homicídio culposo, quando não há intenção de matar. Entretanto, o resultado da perícia que mostrou o excesso de velocidade contribuiu para a mudança na classificação do crime. Além disso, o pedreiro não tem Carteira Nacional de Habilitação CNH e, por isso, também responderá por direção inabilitada e o homicídio passou a ser tipificado como doloso. Ele sequer tinha capacidade objetivamente demonstrada pelas provas de um órgão competente de trânsito de ser capaz de evitar um resultado numa situação que exigiria do condutor uma atuação com as práticas de direção defensiva, afirmou o delegado. Lucilene Rodrigues Carneiro Neves e Luan Henrique Rodrigues Neves morreram atropelados por motorista sem CNH ReproduçãoRedes sociais O acidente O acidente foi registrado por uma câmera de segurança. As vítimas voltavam a pé para casa, depois de uma comemoração em família, quando foram atingidas pelo carro. Lucilene Rodrigues Carneiro Neves, de 40 anos, e Lucilene Rodrigues Carneiro Neves, de nove, morreram no local. Após o atropelamento, o veículo bateu em um muro e, em seguida, capotou. Anestor Santos Carvalho foi preso em flagrante e levado para o Presídio de Santa Luzia. A prefeitura da cidade decretou luto oficial no dia 12 de maio, quando os dois corpos foram sepultados. De acordo com o boletim de ocorrência, o homem disse à Polícia Militar que havia bebido uma pequena dose de uísque pela manhã. Mas o teste do bafômetro não apontou a ingestão de álcool. No último dia 11 de maio, o autor saiu de sua casa, percorreu um trajeto de aproximadamente 800 metros, um percurso que duraria cerca de três minutos. Ele alegou que, na noite anterior, havia ingerido um medicamento para dormir e que havia trabalhado o dia todo naquele Dia das Mães, detalhou o delegado. Ele alega que dormiu ao volante. A Polícia Civil aguarda o resultado do laudo pericial que vai confirmar essa versão. A Secretaria Estadual de Justiça e Segurança Pública informou que, atualmente, Anestor está detido no Presídio Inspetor Martinho Drumond, em Ribeirão das Neves.

Qualquer pessoa pode se passar por brasileiro como país se tornou esconderijo para espiões russos,"Reportagem do The New York Times revelou como agentes secretos russos têm usado passaporte brasileiro para lavar suas identidades, tornando o Brasil uma fábrica de espiões. Acusado de ser espião russo, Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov fingia ser o brasileiro Victor Müller Ferreira TV GloboReprodução Uma reportagem publicada pelo jornal americano The New York Times revelou como o Brasil se tornou uma fábrica de espiões russos. Em entrevista ao podcast O Assunto, o repórter Álvaro Pereira Júnior, do Fantástico, explicou como brechas no sistema de registro civil e a facilidade de obtenção de documentos autênticos permitiram que pelo menos nove cidadãos russos lavassem suas identidades no país e se passassem por brasileiros enquanto atuavam como agentes secretos de Vladimir Putin. A estratégia revelada pelo The New York Times envolvia obter certidões de nascimento, muitas vezes em zonas rurais do país, com a ajuda de testemunhas e sem necessidade de documentação prévia. Com isso, os agentes conseguiam emitir RG, CPF e, por fim, passaporte brasileiro  documento considerado forte no cenário internacional, uma vez que não exige visto em boa parte do mundo e qualquer pessoa de qualquer aparência pode se passar por brasileiro. O Brasil é multiétnico, tem um povo com traços diversos e não exige visto em muitos países, resume Álvaro, ao explicar por que o país é considerado o esconderijo perfeito. Ouça o trecho da entrevista no podcast O Assunto a partir do minuto 6. Kim Jong-un já teve passaporte brasileiro relembre o caso O caso mais emblemático é o de Sergei Cherkasov, que se apresentou como Victor Miller Ferreira e tentou estagiar no Tribunal Penal Internacional, na Holanda, e acabou preso em 2022. Ele e pelo menos outros oito agentes secretos russos usaram o Brasil para lavar suas identidades e, aos olhos do mundo, serem considerados brasileiros.

"Por conta de erosão, governo federal reconhece emergência em estação que abastece água para 60 de Rio Branco","Medida foi publicada no Diário Oficial da União e permite que o município acesse recursos emergenciais para contribuir na solução dos problemas. ETA II enfrenta problemas estruturais e já teve o funcionamento interrompido diversas vezes. ETA II, que abastece 60 da capital acreana, enfrenta problemas estruturais ArquivoSecom Por conta de problemas estruturais e instabilidade do solo, inclusive com erosão, o governo federal reconheceu a situação de emergência na Estação de Tratamento de Água ETA II de Rio Branco. A medida foi publicada no Diário Oficial da União DOU dessa quarta-feira 21, por meio de portaria do Ministério da Integração e do Desenvolvimento Regional MIDR e a Defesa Civil Nacional.  Participe do canal do g1 AC no WhatsApp Balseiros se acumulam em bomba de captação da ETA I em Rio Branco A ETA II abastece todo o Segundo Distrito e parte do primeiro, um universo de mais de 250 mil pessoas espalhadas por mais de 50 bairros e o equivalente a 60 da área urbana da capital. A situação de emergência na ETA II havia sido decretada por meio do Decreto N.º 1572, de abril deste ano. O documento, assinado pelo prefeito Tião Bocalom PL, ressalta que ambas as ETAs da capital acreana têm problemas na estrutura e risco iminente de desabastecimento para 100 dos domicílios de Rio Branco. LEIA MAIS Após colapso no abastecimento de água, Rio Branco recebe novas motobombas para ampliação do sistema ETA II tem problemas em equipamentos e instabilidade no solo Vitória GuimarãesRede Amazônica Acre Com o reconhecimento, o município vai poder acessar recursos emergenciais para contribuir na solução dos problemas. Segundo o MIDR, o Acre tem 12 reconhecimentos vigentes, sendo 10 por inundações, um por erosão de margem fluvial e um por chuvas intensas. Solo da ETA II, em Rio Branco, é instável Marcos AraújoSecom Sistema em colapso Nos últimos anos, o sistema de abastecimento de água da capital tem enfrentado diversos problemas e chegou a entrar em colapso em alguns momentos. A capital acreana é abastecida por duas estações de tratamento de água, ETA I e ETA II, e ambas apresentaram diversas falhas desde março de 2024. Em julho do ano passado, parte da estrutura da ETA II desabou após sofrer com erosões constantes desde que as águas do Rio Acre baixaram após a enchente de 2024. Ninguém se feriu. Novas situações que prejudicaram o fornecimento de água para a população ocorreram nos meses seguintes. Em fevereiro, a prefeitura também decretou emergência na ETA I. ETA II passa por obras após erosão e pane em equipamentos Já em março deste ano, durante a enchente mais recente do Rio Acre, a ETA II ficou sem captação de água a partir do dia 11 após a forte correnteza do manancial e um tronco de árvore virarem uma bomba flutuante, segundo o Saerb. A expectativa era de que a situação normalizasse em 24h, o que não ocorreu. No dia 24 de março, o governo federal anunciou o envio de R 9,5 milhões em recursos para a aquisição de bombas centrífugas utilizadas no saneamento básico. Antes disso, em dezembro do ano passado, o ministro da Integração, Waldez Góes, anunciou quase R 17 milhões para reconstrução da estação.

Ministério do Meio Ambiente nega afastamento de discussão de PL do Licenciamento Ambiental e diz que discutiu ativamente a proposta,"Nesta quarta-feira 21, após aprovação do projeto no Senado, parlamentares criticam ausência de Marina Silva em discussão de projeto que cria Lei Geral do Licenciamento. O Ministério do Meio Ambiente e Mudanças Climáticas afirmou nesta quinta-feira 22 que participou ativamente do processo de discussão do projeto de lei do Licenciamento Ambiental, aprovado no Senado nesta quarta 21. Apesar da proposta ter sido amplamente criticada, antes da aprovação, por ambientalistas e por órgãos do governo, como o Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis Ibama, parlamentares reclamaram da ausência da ministra do Meio Ambiente, Marina Silva, e do afastamento do Ministério das discussões com o passar do tempo. São inverídicas as afirmações de que o Ministério do Meio Ambiente e Mudança do Clima MMA não atuou para impedir o avanço do Projeto de Lei PL 215921 no Senado Federal. O licenciamento ambiental, cerne da proposta, é instrumento crucial para a preservação do meio ambiente e combate à mudança do clima no país. Portanto, desde o início do governo, o MMA tem se empenhado no diálogo com o Congresso Nacional e discutido o projeto com afinco, pontuou o Ministério em nota. Ao longo de 2023, quando a proposta foi debatida com maior intensidade no Senado, o ministério se reuniu diversas vezes com seu relator na Comissão de Meio Ambiente CMA, senador Confúcio Moura, e em algumas ocasiões com sua relatora na Comissão de Agricultura e Reforma Agrária CRA, senadora Tereza Cristina. Participou de todas as etapas de discussão do projeto, incluindo audiência pública realizada conjuntamente pela CMA e pela CRA em 31 de maio daquele ano, tendo inclusive contribuído para a elaboração do primeiro relatório de Moura.

Espião russo aprendeu forró para se passar por brasileiro Fantástico foi a escola e conheceu professor Chocado,"Segundo o professor de dança, o espião Sergey Cherkasov frequentava os encontros com tanta dedicação que, por um período, participou das aulas cinco vezes por semana por cerca de três horas por dia. Reportagem do Fantástico foi originalmente exibida em 2022. Passaporte falso e aulas de forró como era a rotina do espião russo preso com passaporte brasileiro na Europa Um espião russo se infiltrou no Brasil, aprendeu português fluente e chegou a fazer aulas de forró para reforçar sua identidade falsa como um típico brasileiro. O caso voltou à tona em nesta quarta-feira 21, quando o jornal americano The New York Times expôs como o Brasil se tornou uma fábrica de espiões do governo de Moscou. A história de Sergey Cherkasov é acompanhada de perto há mais de três anos pelo jornalista Álvaro Pereira Jr. Em 2022, ele reconstruiu os passos do espião no Brasil e chegou a visitar a escola de dança que ele frequentava. A reportagem foi originalmente exibida no Fantástico no dia 27 de novembro de 2022 veja acima. O repórter Álvaro Pereira Jr. foi convidado de Natuza Nery no episódio desta quinta 22 do podcast O Assunto, que mostrou novas descobertas sobre o caso. Quem é Sergey Cherkasov ou Victor Muller Ferreira Em 2022, um homem que se apresentava como Victor Muller Ferreira, com documentos brasileiros legítimos à primeira vista, tentou conquistar uma vaga de estágio no Tribunal Penal Internacional TPI, em Haia. A tentativa fracassou quando o serviço de inteligência da Holanda descobriu que se tratava, na verdade, de um agente russo. Impedido de entrar no país, ele foi extraditado e enviado de volta ao Brasil, onde permanece preso até hoje. EXCLUSIVO espião preso no Brasil recebia ajuda de funcionário da diplomacia russa no país ENTENDA Sergey Cherkasov e funcionário da diplomacia russa no Brasil são indiciados por lavagem de dinheiro Discreto, bem comportado e leitor voraz a vida do espião russo preso em Brasília Victor Muller era, na verdade, Sergey Cherkasov, um espião treinado pela inteligência militar da Rússia. Ele fazia parte de uma rede que utilizava o Brasil como base para construir identidades falsas  uma espécie de lavanderia de cidadanias. Segundo a investigação da Polícia Federal sobre o caso à época, que o Fantástico teve acesso, Cherkasov recebia ajuda de um funcionário da diplomacia russa no Brasil. Para incorporar o jeitinho brasileiro, Cherkasov chegou a fazer aulas de forró na Grande São Paulo. Segundo o professor de dança Pheliphe Britto, o espião frequentava os encontros com tanta dedicação que, por um período, participou das aulas cinco vezes por semana por cerca de três horas por dia. E chegou a conhecer uma namorada no local. Eu fiquei chocado, né? Um cara superbacana, um cara comunicativo, um cara que saía com a gente para dançar, e depois a gente descobrir que o cara é um espião russo, contou Pheliphe Britto no Fantástico. Com boa formação, de 2015 a 2018 ele cursou ciência política no Trinity College, na Irlanda. Lá, dizia que era o brasileiro Victor Ferreira. Depois, foi fazer mestrado nos Estados Unidos, onde continuou se apresentando como brasileiro. Estudou relações internacionais na prestigiosa universidade John Hopkins, perto de Washington. Nas primeiras semanas de prisão no Brasil, Sergey Cherkasov negou que fosse russo. Insistia que era Victor Ferreira, filho de um português com uma brasileira, e criado por uma tia na Argentina. Depois de dois meses de cadeia em São Paulo e de receber a visita de um diplomata russo, finalmente o suposto Victor confessou que se chamava Sergey Cherkasov. Desde dezembro de 2022, Cherkasov cumpre pena na Penitenciária Federal de Brasília, considerada uma das mais seguras do país. Pouco tempo depois, o governo russo passou a alegar que ele é um traficante de heroína e abriu um processo para pedir sua extradição. Especialistas alegam que se trata de uma estratégia russa para repatriar agentes secretos disfarçados. Segundo as novas investigações do New York Times, pelo menos outros oito agentes secretos russos teriam adotado a mesma estratégia, forjando uma vida brasileira para atuar no exterior sob uma identidade aparentemente legítima.

Além de Nayara, de 25 anos, outras duas mulheres foram presas, sendo a mãe dela, Angela de Macedo, de 50 anos, e Julia Gabriela de Siqueira Freitas, de 27 anos.

Produtos foram apreendidos durante operação DivulgaçãoPolícia Civil Investigação A investigação teve início em agosto de 2023, após uma vítima denunciar a compra de perfumes importados por meio das redes sociais de Nayara. Ela afirmava vender produtos de desapego de importados, ostentando aparência de pessoa influente e com alto padrão de vida. A vítima pagou R 857,90 por frascos supostamente das marcas Chanel, Dior e Victorias Secret, mas ao receber os itens, identificou que se tratavam de falsificações. Em abril de 2024, foram cumpridos mandados de busca que resultaram na apreensão de grande quantidade de cosméticos e perfumes com marcas famosas.

"Cid se abalou ao implicar colegas e fazia defesa irracional da sua honra a amigos, diz testemunha","Capitão do Exército disse que ex-ajudante de Bolsonaro tentou manter dever ético-militar e não quis entregar militares. STF ouviu testemunhas indicadas pela defesa de Cid. O ex-ajudante de ordens do ex-presidente da República Jair Messias Bolsonaro, tenente-coronel Mauro Cid, chega na sua casa no setor militar urbano de Brasília, nesta quinta-feira 21, após prestar depoimento no Supremo Tribunal Federal STF. WILTON JUNIORESTADÃO CONTEÚDO O capitão Raphael Maciel Monteiro afirmou nesta quinta-feira 22, em depoimento ao Supremo Tribunal Federal STF, que o tenente-coronel Mauro Cid, após ter sido preso, fazia uma espécie de defesa irracional de sua honra. O capitão foi ouvido como testemunha de defesa do tenente-coronel Mauro Cid na ação penal que apura um golpe de estado para manter o ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro PL no poder de forma ilegal. O militar foi questionado sobre áudios enviados por Mauro Cid e afirmou que o ex-ajudante de ordens de Bolsonaro tinha necessidade de falar coisas para seu ciclo mais próximo. Para Monteiro, algumas dessas falas eram feitas sem a devida reflexão. Ele eventualmente, para o círculo mais íntimo, ele tinha a necessidade de falar coisas, eu penso muito irrefletidas, fruto de uma defesa digamos irracional de sua honra, disse. Ele relatou ser amigo de Mauro Cid e contou que visitou o colega na prisão. De acordo com Monteiro, o tenente-coronel sentiu quando outros militares foram envolvidos nas investigações da trama golpista. O abalo dele começou a partir do momento em que a conduta da defesa dele mesmo acabou implicando demais militares e isso provocou um certo afastamento institucional. A partir daí o coronel Cid teve um entristecimento e um abalo em seu estado de espírito, disse. O capitão ressaltou ainda que Cid queria se manter firme ao dever ético-militar. Ex-comandante da Aeronáutica confirma ao STF reunião golpista com Jair Bolsonaro O coronel Cid falou aquelas coisas, mas ele tinha essa necessidade de se manter fiel ao dever ético-militar de amar a verdade e por outro não ser o elemento que acaba entregando eventualmente subordinados, não por querer, mas por se manter firme na linha de amar a verdade, disse Raphael Monteiro. Ele ainda negou que tenha tratado de qualquer plano golpista com Mauro Cid.",https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2025/05/22/cid-se-abalou-ao-implicar-colegas-e-fazia-defesa-irracional-da-sua-honra-a-amigos-diz-testemunha.ghtml,2025-05-22T14:16:26,G1,Brazil,pt

O pilar da inclusão digital em cidades inteligentes,"Como a Internet das Coisas IoT está transformando a conectividade em direito básico e promovendo a inclusão digital nas cidades inteligentes. A tecnologia e a informação desempenham papéis fundamentais no desenvolvimento urbano e bem-estar da população, uma vez que contribuem diretamente com a formação individual, o desenvolvimento econômico e a vida social. Esse tema está cada vez mais presente nas discussões realizadas pelas cidades inteligentes, que entendem a conectividade como um direito básico na vida do cidadão, implantando políticas públicas que garantam a inclusão digital com internet de qualidade e acessível para todos. Bill Furlow, Estrategista Sênior nas áreas de Energia e Automação Industrial, destaca a importância do uso da IoT na educação e a consequência disso para toda a sociedade Assim como a invenção da imprensa, a inclusão digital democratiza a informação. Independentemente da riqueza ou localização física, toda pessoa merece acesso à educação  e isso pode ser viabilizado por meio da conectividade. Uma população bem informada e educada está mais preparada para participar da sociedade  e isso beneficia a todos. Cidades inteligentes têm a conectividade como uma ferramenta básica em diferentes perspectivas. De um lado está a população, que usufrui da tecnologia para suprir as demandas do seu dia a dia, seja na vida pessoal, seja na vida profissional. De outro lado está a própria cidade, que utiliza tecnologia e dados para melhorar a eficiência dos sistemas públicos e garantir melhor qualidade de vida para a população. É aí que a Internet das coisas IoT passa a ser um pilar na inclusão digital das cidades inteligentes, já que a tecnologia permite que dispositivos e sensores interconectados coletem e processem dados, em tempo real, capazes de criar ambientes urbanos mais conectados, como por exemplo, auxiliar na expansão da cobertura da rede, conectando áreas remotas ou menos favorecidas com Wi-FI comunitário. Um exemplo brasileiro dessa tecnologia é São Paulo. A cidade paulistana, uma das maiores do mundo, utiliza sensores de IoT de baixo custo para expandir a conectividade para áreas periféricas através de redes de Wi-FI públicas. Os temas relacionados à organização social urbana, inerentes à pessoas de qualquer classe social, também são beneficiados com a IoT, uma vez que essa tecnologia permite a coleta e gestão de grandes volumes de dados, que são frequentemente utilizados para garantir o acesso à informação e serviços relacionados à saúde, transporte, segurança, educação e processos de governança digital. Esse é o caso de Londres. A capital inglesa implementou sensores IoT para monitoramento do tráfego e integração de dados de mobilidade urbana, o que possibilitou à sua população o acesso, em tempo real, a serviços de transporte público. Não se pode deixar de destacar a relevância da inclusão digital para o desenvolvimento econômico. Sobre isso, Furlow traz uma importante contribuição Em termos práticos, a conectividade gera uma cultura de consumo acelerada. A riqueza é criada e o comércio pode ocorrer muito mais rapidamente no ambiente digital do que quando era limitado a lojas físicas e ao mercado regional. Você, eu, todos nós participamos dessa oportunidade de vender e comprar produtos e serviços para um público muito maior. Ficamos mais bem informados sobre eventos econômicos e mundiais, mais instruídos sobre como aproveitar oportunidades. Tudo isso impulsiona o crescimento econômico, mas também fortalece conexões mais profundas e amplas entre os diferentes grupos sociais. A conectividade não é mais um luxo, ela é essencial. Dentro desse panorama, fica mais do que claro, que a inclusão digital é uma questão de justiça social. Uma tecnologia de necessidade básica, fundamental para a participação social, o acesso à educação, geração de renda e serviços públicos. Em setembro, nos dias 3 e 4, São Paulo irá sediar o IoT Solutions Congress Brasil, um evento que traz reflexões e discussões sobre o tema, reunindo especialistas e soluções que mostram, na prática, como a tecnologia pode ser aplicada não apenas para melhorar a cidade, mas para protegê-la e salvar vidas.",https://g1.globo.com/pr/parana/especial-publicitario/icities-the-smart-cities-hub/noticia/2025/05/22/o-pilar-da-inclusao-digital-em-cidades-inteligentes.ghtml,2025-05-22T13:51:45,G1,Brazil,pt

Entenda as fraudes de azeite mais comuns no Brasil O governo proibiu, nesta quinta-feira 22, a comercialização, distribuição, fabricação, propaganda e uso de mais duas marcas de azeite Almazara e Escarpas das Oliveiras. A proibição ocorreu após denúncia do Ministério da Agricultura e Pecuária e ação fiscalizatória da Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária Anvisa, que publicou a proibição no Diário Oficial da União desta quinta. Segundo a decisão, os azeites foram proibidos porque têm como embaladora a empresa ORIENTE MERCANTIL IMPORTAÇÃO E EXPORTAÇÃO LTD Super Mercado Oriente, que teve seu CNPJ extinto em novembro de 2023. O g1 não encontrou o contato das marcas, apenas da embaladora. Até a última atualização desta reportagem, a empresa não respondeu ao contato. LISTA veja todas as marcas que tiveram algum veto do governo desde 2024 É a segunda proibição de azeites feita pelo governo federal na semana. Na terça, os azeites das marcas Alonso e Quintas DOliveira também foram vetados pela Anvisa após denúncias do Ministério da Agricultura. Em outubro de 2024, o Ministério da Agricultura realizou apreensões e proibiu a venda de lotes das quatro marcas. Na época, a instituição informou que os produtos apresentavam risco à saúde devido à incerteza sobre a sua origem e composição. Ainda em outubro, Ministério da Agricultura esclareceu que existem duas marcas de azeites chamadas Alonso, mas de empresas diferentes. A primeira é de origem chilena e exportada pela Agrícola Pobena S.A, que é regular. A empresa proibida pelo governo na terça-feira é representada pela Comércio de Gêneros Alimentícios Cotinga Ltda., que tem origem desconhecida.

"Emirados Árabes, 2 maior cliente da carne de frango brasileira, entram na lista de bloqueios","Extensão de bloqueio por causa da gripe aviária varia alguns países pararam de comprar toda a produção brasileira outros, somente a regional, o que minimiza impacto para as exportações. Campanha contra gripe aviária é necessária mesmo nos locais sem registro da doença Thais PassosPrefeitura de Piracicaba O Ministério da Agricultura atualizou nesta quinta-feira 22 a lista de países que deixaram de receber carne de frango do Brasil, depois do primeiro registro de gripe aviária em uma granja comercial no Brasil, identificado no Rio Grande do Sul, na última quinta-feira 15. Na nova atualização, os Emirados Árabes Unidos, segundo maior cliente da exportação brasileira, foram incluídos na lista de embargo às exportações de frango do município de Montenegro. É nele onde está localizado o foco da doença. Veja abaixo lista completa. Alguns bloqueios valem para a produção do setor em todo o país e outros são mais localizados. Quando os bloqueios são aplicados apenas em Montenegro, o impacto nas vendas para o exterior é praticamente zero. Isso porque há apenas um frigorífico que exporta frango no município e ele fica fora do raio de 10 km do foco da doença, afirma o secretário-adjunto de Comércio e Relações Internacionais do Ministério da Agricultura, Marcel Moreira. Além da inclusão dos Emirados Árabes na lista, a União Eurasiática agora está restringindo apenas as compras vindas do Rio Grande do Sul. Antes, a nação havia bloqueado a carne de frango de todo o Brasil. Já a Arábia Saudita ampliou o embargo para o Rio Grande do Sul. Anteriormente, ele estava acontecendo apenas no município de Montenegro. O Brasil é o maior exportador de frango do mundo. As restrições são feitas para evitar a contaminação de granjas de outros países, mas não há risco no consumo de carne de frango e ovos. O trabalho de desinfecção da granja de Montenegro terminou na quarta-feira 21 e, a partir desta quinta, se o Brasil não registrar nenhum outro caso em 28 dias, pode se declarar livre da doença. No entanto, o fim do prazo não significa que todos os mercados se abrirão imediatamente, disse o ministro da Agricultura Carlos Fávaro. Muitos vão fazer questionamento, tirar dúvidas e é normal, acrescentou. Por que países suspenderam compra, se não há risco para consumo? Como o Brasil busca evitar novos casos de gripe aviária?

"Foi uma menina amada e feliz, diz mãe de criança com doença rara que morreu após síndrome respiratória no AC","Anna Helena dos Santos, de 11 anos, morreu após complicações da Influenza B. Ela tinha a Síndrome de Miller Dieker, que causa lesões no cérebro, mas conseguiu vencer todos os prognósticos médicos que diziam que ela não ultrapassaria os primeiros anos de vida. Anna Helena que tinha doença rara, morreu após complicações de síndrome respiratória no Acre Arquivo pessoal Diagnosticada com uma síndrome rara aos quatro meses de vida, a pequena Anna Helena dos Santos, de 11 anos, morreu vítima de influenza B no último dia 16 de maio, em Rio Branco. A menina passou seis dias internada no Hospital da Criança, pegou pneumonia e não resistiu às complicações da doença.  Participe do canal do g1 AC no WhatsApp O g1 contou a história dela em 2015, quando a funcionária pública Hêgina Barros, de 41 anos, lutava em busca do tratamento da filha. Na época, a mãe contou que a filha foi diagnosticada com Síndrome de Miller Dieker -- que ocasiona uma lesão cerebral genética conhecida como lisencefalia -- e que prejudicava, dentre outros fatores, o desenvolvimento motor e mental. A família fez uma campanha para arrecadar recursos e custear o tratamento da menina no Chile , quando ela tinha apenas 1 ano. Porém, a viagem para o exterior não aconteceu e ela recebeu tratamento no Brasil. Anna Helena foi internada no dia 10 deste mês após ter febre pela madrugada. O pai a levou ao hospital, ela foi medicada e a família acreditava que sairia no mesmo dia. Contudo, a mãe dela recordou que a criança foi diagnosticada com influenza B e, então, os médicos decidiram interná-la. Estávamos tranquilos. Fui para lá assim que terminei um compromisso, porém, quando chegaram os exames, no mesmo dia, veio o diagnóstico. Na segunda 12, ela fez uma tomografia e deu pneumonia unilateral e já estava no O2 níveis baixos de oxigênio no sangue fraquinho, relembrou a mãe.

Ela chegou já com insuficiência respiratória e a entubaram. Na sexta 16, ela faleceu pois a pneumonia agravou e tomou todo o pulmão dela, lamentou. Hêgina relembrou que a morte da filha foi muito rápida e não conseguiu transferi-la para outra cidade. Ainda segundo ela, a causa da morte não tem relação direta com a síndrome rara que Anna Helena tinha, mas acredita que a situação agravou por conta desta condição. Não pudemos fazer nada. Foi muito rápido. A causa da morte não tem relação direta com a síndrome, mas acredita-se que por ter a doença rara era mais suscetível a falecer por questões respiratórias. Os médicos acreditam que ela já vinha ficando debilitada devido à evolução da síndrome. Estamos tentando entender. O estado está sob alerta nesses casos de síndromes respiratórias e, infelizmente, a Anna Helena é mais um número, relatou Hêgina. Aumento nos casos de síndromes gripais faz governo decretar emergência em saúde A médica Bruna Beyruth, que acompanhou Anna Helena, explicou que a menina era uma criança muito amada. Foi muito difícil para mim também perder a Helena porque foi uma das primeiras pacientes graves que tive. Precisei estudar e aprender mais sobre a doença. Então, digo que a Helena me ensinou muito. Nunca vi uma família tão dedicada e tão pé no chão. Ela foi uma menina que superou muito as nossas expectativas. Em todo o processo, a Helena sempre sorriu, nunca foi uma criança ausente, então, acho que ela cumpriu o seu papel, falou. Muito amada De acordo com a mãe, o prognóstico de vida, inicialmente informado pelos médicos, era de que Anna Helena não ultrapassaria os primeiros anos, mas superando todos os obstáculos, a criança conseguiu viver até os 11 anos. Hêgina relatou que a filha recebeu diversos cuidados médicos para que tivesse qualidade de vida, e ela era uma criança muito ativa, participava de projetos sociais, ia para a escola, viajava e era uma criança muito amada. Helena era uma criança muito amada por todos que tiveram a oportunidade de conhecê-la ... não esperávamos que ela teria uma morte tão rápida, mas sabíamos da gravidade e limitação dela. Então, não tenho dúvida que Helena foi uma menina muito amada e feliz. Temos muito orgulho dela, finalizou.

As prisões aconteceram na manhã desta quinta-feira 22.  Receba as notícias do g1 Roraima no WhatsApp Um policial militar de Roraima também foi preso. A Rede Amazônica apurou que a mulher presa é vereadora pelo município de Caracaraí, ao Sul de Roraima, e também atua como policial civil no estado. O crime aconteceu no município de Caracaraí, em fevereiro de 2023. À época, a Polícia Militar informou que a vítima estava trabalhando quando foi algemada, ameaçada e agredida com tapas e choques elétricos entenda mais abaixo. Batizada de Operação Jeremias 2217, a ação cumpre sete mandados de prisão temporária e 13 de busca e apreensão em Roraima, Amazonas, Bahia, São Paulo e Rio Grande do Sul. Eles foram determinados após investigações com participação direta da Promotoria de Justiça de Caracaraí. As investigações apontam que os envolvidos formaram um grupo criminoso para escoltar cargas de minérios extraídos ilegalmente da Terra Indígena Yanomami, prestar serviços de segurança de forma clandestina e apurar a ocorrência de roubos de cargas de forma paralela à atuação estatal. De acordo com a Polícia Federal, na busca de um suposto roubo de cassiterita, os policiais do Amazonas sequestraram e torturam o homem para que ele indicasse o destino da carga. A suspeita é de que policiais de Roraima também participaram dos crimes.

Além disso, ele sofreu choques na região do tórax. À Polícia Militar, o pai da vítima relatou que estava trabalhando em um terreno com o filho quando um carro parou no local e três homens desceram do veículo. Segundo o relato, os homens se identificaram como policiais civis e um deles perguntou a localização da vicinal 4, onde estaria ocorrendo uma briga. Por conta disso, em uma motocicleta, a vítima os acompanhou até o local. No entanto, quando chegou ao local indicado, o homem foi algemado e ameaçado com tapas e choques elétricos. Além disso, os suspeitos afirmaram que incendiariam a motocicleta dele caso não colaborasse. Com a vítima, eles seguiram até o município de Iracema e posteriormente seguiram para Mucajaí. Dentro do carro, a vítima foi pressionada a cerca de alguma informação sobre um caminhão graneleiro que, segundo os suspeitos, foi furtado e transportava cassiterita, um metal usado para produzir ligas. Durante o interrogatório, outros três homens chegaram ao local e informaram que pertenciam ao Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais Bope. Na ocasião, eles pegaram o celular da vítima para averiguar se ele estava envolvido no caso ou se tinha informações sobre o paradeiro de um outro homem. Ao fim da ação, eles liberaram a vítima e, inclusive, lhe deram R 60 para que ele pegasse um ônibus rodoviário e retornasse para Caracaraí. Os dois policiais do Amazonas foram presos à época, após serem denunciados.

O ministro da Saúde palestino afirmou nesta quinta-feira 22 que 29 crianças morreram de fome na Faixa de Gaza nos últimos dias por conta da falta de alimentos. Nos últimos dias, perdemos 29 crianças, disse o ministro da Saúde palestino, Majed Abu Ramadan, que disse que as mortes são relacionadas à fome. Ramadan afirmou ainda que milhares de outras crianças estão em risco de vida por conta da falta de alimentos. Israel bloqueou totalmente a entrada de ajuda humanitária em Gaza há 11 semanas, e disse ter liberado envio de alimentos aos palestinos nesta semana, mas ONU e ONGs que atuam no território afirmam que os suprimentos que entraram até o momento são insuficientes. ONU alerta que crianças não estão recebendo comida em Gaza devido ao bloqueio imposto por Israel. REUTERSMahmoud Issa Nesta quarta-feira 21, o primeiro-ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, afirmou que as forças israelenses tomarão o controle do território palestino e que os civis serão deslocados de zonas de combate para o sul do território. Ao fim do esforço, todas as áreas da Faixa de Gaza estarão sob controle de segurança de Israel  e o Hamas será totalmente derrotado, disse. O primeiro-ministro também estabeleceu condições para terminar a guerra. Segundo ele, o conflito só será suspenso se todos os reféns forem libertados e o Hamas deixar o controle da Faixa de Gaza. Afirmou que vem resistindo a pressões de outros países e de dentro de Israel para interromper a guerra. Segundo ele, se os combates forem encerrados antes que todos os objetivos sejam atingidos, o Hamas se reconstruirá e continuará no poder.

Kim Jong-un já teve passaporte brasileiro relembre o caso,"História voltou a ganhar destaque em meio à descoberta de fábrica de espiões russos no Brasil, revelada pelo jornal americano The New York Times. Kim Jong-Un teve passaporte emitido no Brasil Handout via Reuters A revelação de que o ditador da Coreia do Norte, Kim Jong-un, já usou um passaporte brasileiro para circular pelo mundo voltou a ganhar destaque em meio à descoberta de uma rede de espionagem russa com ramificações no Brasil. Nesta quarta-feira 21, o jornal americano The New York Times expôs como o Brasil se tornou uma fábrica de espiões russos. Em entrevista ao podcast O Assunto, o repórter Álvaro Pereira Júnior, do Fantástico, relembrou o episódio inusitado com Kim Jong-Un segundo ele, o documento foi emitido pela Embaixada do Brasil em Praga nos anos 1990 para o líder da Coreia do Norte e seu pai , com os nomes falsos de Josef Pwag e Ijong Tchoi. Apareceu algum procurador dele com documentos falsos. A Embaixada do Brasil em Praga emitiu o passaporte para o Kim Jong Um para ele passear pelo mundo. Então houve viagens em que ele tinha ali um passaporte brasileiro, explica Álvaro Pereira Júnior. Ouça a entrevista completa no podcast O Assunto A história foi publicada no g1 em abril de 2018, informada pelo Ministério das Relações Exteriores e confirmada pelo Itamaraty. De acordo com a agência Reuters, tanto Kim Jong-un quanto seu pai, Kim Jong-il, teriam usado identidades falsas com documentos autênticos para pedir vistos a países ocidentais. À época, o passaporte brasileiro era mais fácil de ser falsificado. Embora os sistemas tenham evoluído e hoje o controle seja mais rígido, o documento segue extremamente cobiçado, uma vez que não exige visto em boa parte do mundo e qualquer pessoa de qualquer aparência pode se passar por brasileiro, afirma Álvaro.

"Venezuela fará eleição em Essequibo, território da Guiana que Caracas reivindica como seu","A Venezuela elegerá no domingo 25 o governador e oito deputados para o Parlamento de Essequibo, a gigantesca região rica em petróleo que está em disputa há mais de um século com a Guiana. É a primeira vez que a Venezuela pretende eleger autoridades para esse território de 160.000 km² sobre o qual não tem nenhum controle, já que a administração é da Guiana. Ninguém no próprio Essequibo poderá participar. Os centros de votação estarão no estado fronteiriço de Bolívar, onde também vivem os pouco mais de 21.400 eleitores que formam essa recém-criada circunscrição, sobrerrepresentada em comparação com a média nacional. É inabalável a nossa vontade de recuperar os direitos históricos, territoriais e para além da Guiana Essequiba, expressou o presidente venezuelano, Nicolás Maduro, na quarta-feira. Seu homólogo guianês, Irfaan Ali, disse à AFP que o processo era uma mostra de desespero e propaganda da Venezuela, embora tenha identificado ao mesmo tempo como uma ameaça. Abaixo, veja o que se sabe dessa eleição, que no total elege 24 governadores e 285 deputados para o Parlamento sem a participação da oposição majoritária. Simbolismo A Venezuela sustenta que herdou Essequibo da era colonial espanhola e em 3 de dezembro de 2023 celebrou um referendo sobre a soberania desse território, embora sem a participação da sua população. O mesmo agora na eleição do primeiro governador, que cumprirá funções de outro estado e não terá nenhum tipo de autoridade sobre os habitantes dessa região. Não existe jurisdição nem exercerão soberania, explicou Ricardo de Toma, pesquisador venezuelano do tema Essequibo no Instituto Meira Mattos no Rio de Janeiro. A eleição é simbólica, o mandato será simbólico. O cientista político Gabriel Flores, no entanto, vê as eleições como um ato estratégico da Venezuela para reafirmar o domínio sobre o território em disputa. Disputa centenária O referendo de 2023 deu lugar à lei venezuelana que cria o estado da Guiana Essequiba, ao mesmo tempo que a tensão com a Guiana chegou a um ponto de tal ebulição que houve alertas regionais sobre um possível conflito bélico. A disputa pela soberania do Essequibo é centenária, embora tenha recrudescido em 2015 depois que a petroleira americana ExxonMobil descobriu grandes jazidas de petróleo na região em disputa. A Guiana pediu à Corte Internacional de Justiça CIJ que ratificasse as fronteiras estabelecidas em um laudo de 1899. A Venezuela, por sua vez, apela ao Acordo de Genebra que assinou em 1966 antes da independência da Guiana do Reino Unido e que anulava o laudo anterior e assentava as bases para uma solução negociada. Eleitores duplos O Conselho Nacional Eleitoral CNE, acusado de servir ao chavismo, informou que o registro eleitoral para domingo é de 21,6 milhões de eleitores. Não há detalhamento. O site do CNE está fora do ar desde a madrugada de 29 de julho de 2024, quando o presidente Nicolás Maduro foi proclamado vencedor da eleição presidencial, que o conselho diz ter sido alvo de um ataque cibernético. A AFP tomou conhecimento da lista de 21.403 eleitores da Guiana Essequiba - como o estado foi batizado em uma lei de 2024 - de dois candidatos à eleição. Eles estão distribuídos, em princípio, em duas paróquias do estado de Bolívar e votarão nas autoridades de ambas as entidades. O candidato do chavismo é o ex-comandante da Marinha venezuelana Neil Villamizar. Alexis Duarte é da ala da oposição, que rejeitou o apelo da líder María Corina Machado para não participar. - Militares -A Guiana reforçou sua presença militar na fronteira no período que antecedeu as eleições. E, na semana passada, denunciou um suposto ataque a suas tropas na mesma área em que relatou outro em março. Não vamos cair em provocações, disse o ministro da Defesa da Venezuela, Vladimir Padrino, que incluiu na saudação militar a frase O sol da Venezuela nasce no Essequibo. A presença de um navio de guerra britânico na Guiana em 2023 levou a Venezuela a mobilizar mais de 5.600 soldados em exercícios militares perto da fronteira com a área disputada. Foi aí que os países vizinhos intervieram para acalmar os ânimos. O chefe da diplomacia dos EUA, Marco Rubio, alertou em março que qualquer ataque não terminaria bem para a Venezuela.",https://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2025/05/22/venezuela-fara-eleicao-em-essequibo-territorio-da-guiana-que-caracas-reivindica-como-seu.ghtml,2025-05-22T13:37:31,G1,Brazil,pt
Viagens de trem entre PA e MA são suspensas após protesto na Estrada de Ferro Carajás,"Passageiros foram orientados a remarcar viagem ou pedir reembolso. Trem liga as cidades de Parauapebas, no Pará, e São Luís, no Maranhão. Estrada de Ferro Carajás, no Pará Reprodução O trem de passageiros que liga Parauapebas, no sudeste do Pará, a São Luís, no Maranhão, foi suspenso nesta quinta-feira 22 e sexta 23 devido a uma interdição em Parauapebas, no Pará. Segundo a concessionária Vale, o cancelamento das viagens é por questão de segurança, devido à interdição da Estrada de Ferro Carajás por integrantes do Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra MST. A manifestação começou na madrugada desta quinta-feira. O g1 tentava contato com o MST até a publicação da reportagem. A Ferrovia Carajás realiza viagens de trem de São Luís, no Maranhão, até Parauapebas, no Pará. São cerca de 1.500 passageiros por viagem, em média, entre os estados. Em março, as viagens também ficaram suspensas por alguns dias após protesto da etnia Gavião da Terra Indígena Mãe Maria, no Pará. Indígenas bloqueiam trecho de ferrovia que liga o Pará ao Maranhão Suspensão em 22 e 23 de maio Em nota, a Vale disse ainda que respeita o legítimo e pacífico direito à manifestação e repudia qualquer ato que impeça o direito das pessoas ou empresas de desempenharem suas atividades e, sobretudo, que ameace a segurança e o direito de ir e vir. A empresa disse ainda que adotará todas medidas cabíveis para a liberação imediata e segura da linha. Sobre o protesto, a Vale disse que tem compromisso com o Acordo de Cooperação Técnica ACT, assinado em abril deste ano, com o Instituto Nacional de Colonização e Reforma Agrária Incra, para implementar ações conjuntas para contribuir com a regularização fundiária e a reforma agrária no Pará. A respeito das passagens de trem, os passageiros foram orientados a remarcar o bilhete ou pedir o reembolso do valor no prazo de até 30 dias.

Brasil ficará livre de gripe aviária se não tiver novos casos em 28 dias,"Desinfecção da granja de Montenegro RS terminou na quarta-feira 21. A partir desta quinta, governo vai contar 28 dias e, após esse período, pode se declarar livre da doença, caso não haja outro foco. Brasil é o maior exportador de frango do mundo. ReproduçãoRPC O trabalho de desinfecção da granja de Montenegro RS atingida por gripe aviária terminou na quarta-feira 21 e, a partir desta quinta 22, se o Brasil não registrar nenhum outro caso em 28 dias, pode se declarar livre da doença. Esse prazo corresponde ao ciclo do vírus H5N1, explicou o ministro da Agricultura, Carlos Fávaro, na última semana. Passado esse período sem novas ocorrências, o país poderá retomar as exportações de frango.  Os 28 dias são essenciais para garantir que não haja vestígios do vírus no ambiente antes da retomada das atividades na granja, contribuindo para a contenção da doença e a segurança sanitária da avicultura na região. Se em 28 dias não tiver nenhum outro caso, a gente pode com tranquilidade, baseado em ciência, dizer ao mercado e aos outros compradores e colocar o Brasil de novo como país livre de gripe aviária, disse Fávaro.  A gripe aviária não é transmitida pelo consumo de carne de aves e ovos, disse o Ministério da Agricultura. O Brasil nunca teve um caso de gripe aviária em humano. Gripe aviária por que alguns países barraram frango de todo o Brasil e outros só do estado ou município? Como o Brasil busca evitar novos casos de gripe aviária? Por que países suspenderam compra de frango do Brasil, se não há risco para consumo? Segundo ele, o fim do prazo não significa que todos os mercados se abrirão imediatamente. Muitos vão fazer questionamento, tirar dúvidas e é normal, acrescentou. Fávaro previu que, após os 28 dias, os países que restringem a compra de frangos de todo o Brasil  como China e União Europeia  devem reduzir essa limitação apenas ao Rio Grande do Sul, ou só a Montenegro RS, onde o caso foi registrado. E aí, gradativamente, voltamos à normalidade, disse o ministro.

Gripe aviária entenda se é possível se contaminar comendo carne de frango Brasil investiga suspeitas de gripe aviária O Ministério da Agricultura e Pecuária investiga dois casos suspeitos de gripe aviária em granjas comerciais um em Ipumirim SC e outro em Aguiarnópolis TO. Além disso, a pasta também está investigando um caso suspeito envolvendo uma produção familiar para subsistência em Salitre CE. Outros três casos suspeitos que estavam sendo investigados, em Triunfo RS, Graccho Cardoso SE e Nova Brasilândia MT, deram resultado negativo para a doença.

Desses, 166 foram confirmados como sendo casos de gripe aviária, o que representa cerca de 5 das suspeitas.

Arruda foi ouvido como testemunha de defesa do tenente-coronel Mauro Cid, e de Jair Bolsonaro na ação penal que apura um golpe de estado para manter o ex-presidente no poder de forma ilegal.

Como a suplementação pode ajudar a manter a imunidade alta em tempos de maior exposição a vírus,"Descubra os principais sinais de imunidade baixa e como reforçar suas defesas com escolhas acessíveis para o dia a dia ReproduçãoFreepik Mudança de estação, rotina puxada, noites mal dormidas. Nosso corpo enfrenta inúmeros desafios todos os dias  e para manter o ritmo, ele precisa de equilíbrio. É aí que a imunidade entra em cena como um verdadeiro escudo natural. Nosso sistema imunológico é a nossa linha de frente contra vírus, bactérias e outros agressores. Quando ele está fortalecido, o corpo responde melhor às ameaças e se recupera mais rápido. Mas quando esse sistema está sobrecarregado, o corpo começa a enviar sinais. Pequenas infecções que se repetem, cansaço constante, aquela sensação de algo está para vir. São alertas de que está na hora de reforçar as defesas. E a suplementação pode ser uma aliada valiosa nesse processo. Nosso corpo dá sinais. Quando gripes se tornam frequentes ou a recuperação demora, é hora de reforçar as defesas, explica a nutricionista Maria Luísa S. Repula. Sinais de que sua imunidade pode estar baixa Gripes e resfriados recorrentes Cansaço prolongado Infecções urinárias frequentes Feridas que demoram a cicatrizar Coriza leve ou garganta arranhando com frequência Vitaminas e minerais que impactam na sua imunidade Vitamina C e Vitamina D antioxidantes poderosos que auxiliam no funcionamento do sistema imune. Zinco fortalece pele e mucosas, impedindo a entrada de vírus e bactérias. Ômega-3 melhora a integridade das barreiras naturais como o intestino e vias aéreas. Probióticos e Glutamina equilibram a flora intestinal, que está diretamente ligada à nossa imunidade. Inverno e estresse atenção redobrada ReproduçãoFreepik Durante o inverno, passamos mais tempo em ambientes fechados, com menos ventilação e pouca exposição ao sol  o que reduz naturalmente a produção de vitamina D. Ao mesmo tempo, o estresse contínuo da rotina moderna continua, o que compromete o equilíbrio do organismo e pode enfraquecer a resposta imunológica. Nesses períodos de maior exposição a vírus e bactérias, a suplementação estratégica pode atuar como um reforço essencial para manter a imunidade em alta Prevenir é sempre melhor do que remediar Mais do que evitar doenças, uma imunidade fortalecida representa mais disposição, mais vitalidade e mais bem-estar no dia a dia. A suplementação pode contribuir para manter esse equilíbrio, oferecendo suporte nutricional em momentos em que o corpo exige mais  como nas mudanças de estação, em períodos de estresse ou em dietas com baixa variedade.

"Quase 18 da Região Metropolitana de Porto Alegre está em áreas de risco extremo para inundação, aponta estudo","Zonas incluem bairros densamente edificados, apontou artigo publicado em periódico internacional. Em maio de 2024, RS foi atingido por catástrofe climática que deixou 184 mortos e 25 desaparecidos. O Rio Grande do Sul 1 ano depois da enchente que devastou o estado Quase 18 da Região Metropolitana de Porto Alegre está em áreas de risco extremo para inundação. As zonas sob alerta incluem bairros densamente edificados. Os apontamentos constam em um estudo que envolveu pesquisadores ligados ao Centro Nacional de Monitoramento e Alertas de Desastres Naturais Cemaden e ao Instituto de Ciência e Tecnologia da Unesp.  Acesse o canal do g1 RS no WhatsApp Em maio de 2024, o Rio Grande do Sul foi atingido por uma enchente histórica, que provocou danos em quase todos os municípios, devastou cidades, retirou milhares de pessoas de casa e deixou 184 mortos, além de 25 desaparecidos. O nível do Guaíba, em Porto Alegre, chegou a 5,37 metros durante o desastre, de acordo com estimativa do Serviço Geológico do Brasil SGB. Na ocasião, o Instituto de Pesquisas Hídricas IPH da UFRGS apontou que a capital teve 2 mil quarteirões invadidos pela água do Guaíba.

Fraudes no INSS atendimento presencial começa dia 30 e será feito apenas nos Correios governo diz que não é preciso correr,"A decisão foi tomada em um momento em que agências do INSS estão sobrecarregadas, com filas e alta demanda de atendimento. Atendimento presencial acontecerá em 4.730 agências dos Correios, localizadas em 66 das cidades brasileiras. O governo federal anunciou nesta quinta-feira 22 que começará o atendimento presencial às vítimas de fraudes e descontos indevidos no INSS no próximo dia 30.  Esse atendimento será feito apenas nas agências dos Correios, e não nos postos de atendimento do próprio INSS. Segundo o Ministério da Previdência Social, serão mobilizadas 4.730 agências em 66 das cidades brasileiras.  O atendimento virtual pelo aplicativo Meu INSS ou pelo número de telefone 135 segue em vigor, e oferece os mesmos serviços.  A ida a uma agência é apenas uma opção adicional. Segundo o governo, como os descontos já foram suspensos e o ressarcimento ainda não começou, não é preciso correr e nem formar filas. Fraude no INSS como descobrir se você foi uma vítima Quais serviços estarão disponíveis? Segundo a diretora de Governança e Estratégia dos Correios, Juliana Agatte, as agências prestarão os seguintes serviços identificar se o aposentado ou pensionista sofreu descontos mensais  e qual foi a entidade responsável protocolar pedido de informações adicionais informar o retorno do INSS sobre esse pedido, e a data para essa nova visita aos Correios orientar o beneficiário sobre como fazer a contestação e o pedido de ressarcimento. Segundo a diretora, a lista das agências dos Correios com esse atendimento presencial estará disponível nos sites dos Correios e do INSS ou pelo telefone 135. As unidades dos Correios que não tiverem esse atendimento também vão informar a agência mais próxima, acrescentou. Acesso facilitado Segundo o presidente do INSS, Gilberto Waller, quem for ao atendimento presencial pode levar apenas um documento de identidade. Não é preciso apresentar contracheque, por exemplo. Se o beneficiário tiver dificuldades de locomoção, pode enviar um representante com procuração devidamente autêntica, assinada. O representante poderá consultar, junto aos Correios, se a pessoa foi vítima de descontos indevidos. Nem o INSS nem os Correios mandam carta, mandam mensagem. É você que entra na página, no 135, ou que vai nos Correios, explicou Waller. O governo pretende, no entanto, ativar as unidades móveis do INSS as vans do PrevMóvel e as embarcações do PrevBarco para fazer a busca ativa de beneficiários com menor acesso à internet  em comunidades ribeirinhas, por exemplo. A decisão de mobilizar a estrutura dos Correios foi tomada em um momento em que as agências próprias do Instituto estão sobrecarregadas, com filas expressivas e alta demanda de atendimento. Esse atendimento presencial que estamos anunciando hoje, para os próximos dias, significa atendimento olho no olho. Embora saibamos que há um contingente enorme que acessam o aplicativo INSS 135, sabemos que existem aquelas pessoas que preferem os atendimentos nas agências, atendimentos presenciais. É para essas pessoas que estamos abrindo um canal de alternativa para que seja atendidas, disse o ministro da Previdência, Wolney Queiroz. INSS e Correios fecham parceria para atendimento presencial de aposentados e pensionistas A ideia é que os funcionários dos Correios orientem os segurados sobre como proceder para solicitar o reembolso. Esses trabalhadores já realizam atendimentos em nome do INSS, como emissão de extratos e prova de vida. Segundo o ministro Wolney Queiroz, apenas 2 dos chamados que são feitos presencialmente, mas que representam dois milhões de pessoas. A maior parte  98 dos acessos ao INSS, nas contas do governo  é feita pelo 135 ou pelo aplicativo Meu INSS, que seguem valendo. Não precisa correria, alvoroço para atendimento nos Correios. Vamos fazer as coisas com calma. Não há um tempo determinado para que a pessoa busque o ressarcimento. A qualquer tempo, poderá fazer. Se quiser deixar passar o primeiro mês, ou dois meses, o atendimento será o mesmo, o ressarcimento está garantido. É um ordem do presidente Lula que ninguém que foi lesado será prejudicado, disse o ministro da Previdência. Fraude no INSS depois das denúncias entidades usaram sistema paralelo pra conseguir descontos em massa O que se sabe sobre a fraude Segundo a Polícia Federal PF e a Controladoria-Geral da União CGU, as entidades investigadas ofereciam o pagamento de propina a servidores do INSS para obter dados dos beneficiários. Há registros de aposentados que, no mesmo dia, foram filiados a mais de uma entidade. A liberação de descontos em lote pelo INSS, sem autorização individual dos beneficiários, também foi identificada como um fator para a explosão de fraudes. A Polícia Federal e a Controladoria-Geral da União CGU dizem que o prejuízo pode chegar a R 6 bilhões, considerados os anos de 2019 a 2024. A Advocacia-Geral da União AGU entrou neste mês com um pedido de bloqueio de R 2,56 bilhões em bens de 12 associações investigadas. O ministro da Previdência Social, Carlos Lupi, pediu demissão no início deste mês. A avaliação, nos bastidores do governo, é que houve omissão de Lupi. Uma reportagem do Jornal Nacional revelou que o ministro recebeu os primeiros alertas em junho de 2023 e levou quase um ano para agir. Alessandro Stefanutto, que presidia o INSS e foi indicado ao cargo por Lupi, foi demitido após o escândalo ser revelado. Ele foi alvo de uma operação da PF para colher provas da fraude. Mais de 1,7 milhão de aposentados e pensionistas do INSS pediram ressarcimento de descontos",https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2025/05/22/fraude-no-inss-aposentados-serao-atendidos-nos-correios-anuncia-governo.ghtml,2025-05-22T13:19:02,G1,Brazil,pt
Projeto de lei busca impedir uso de bebês reborn para obter prioridade em atendimentos na PB veja outros projetos,"Propostas em tramitação na Assembleia Legislativa da Paraíba e nas câmaras de João Pessoa e Campina Grande miram o uso indevido dos bonecos em serviços públicos e privados. Bebês reborn fenômeno é resultado de romantização e sobrecarga da maternidade, diz psicanalista. Douglas MagnoAFP O uso de bonecos do tipo bebê reborn, que são réplicas realistas de recém-nascidos, entrou no debate político na Paraíba. Projetos de lei apresentados tanto na Assembleia Legislativa ALPB quanto nas câmaras municipais de João Pessoa e Campina Grande propõem sanções a quem utilizar esses bonecos para obter benefícios destinados a pessoas com crianças de colo. Os parlamentares justificam as medidas como forma de evitar fraudes e preservar a prioridade real de quem está com crianças. As propostas preveem, entre outras ações, a proibição de atendimento preferencial a quem portar esses objetos e a aplicação de penalidades administrativas. Projetos em tramitação na ALPB Assembleia Legislativa da Paraíba Foto divulgaçãoALPB Na Assembleia Legislativa da Paraíba ALPB, dois projetos de lei ordinária de autoria do deputado estadual Walber Virgolino PL foram protocolados com o objetivo de regular o uso de bonecos reborn em ambientes públicos e privados. O PLO 43802025, apresentado no dia 20 de maio, propõe a tipificação de infração administrativa para o uso de bonecas reborn ou qualquer outro artefato que simule crianças de colo com o intuito de obter benefícios ou prioridade em atendimentos. O texto deixa claro que a proibição se estende a serviços públicos e privados em todo o estado. Já o PLO 43502025, apresentado dois dias antes, em 18 de maio, tem foco específico nas unidades públicas de saúde. A proposta proíbe o atendimento a bebês reborn nesses espaços e veda a utilização dessas bonecas como justificativa para garantir preferência em serviços destinados a crianças e seus responsáveis. Segundo a ALPB, este projeto foi aprovado. João Pessoa e Campina Grande também discutem o tema Câmara Municipal de João Pessoa Francisco FrançaJornal da Paraíba Na Câmara Municipal de João Pessoa, o vereador Guguinha Moov Jampa PSD apresentou, no dia 21 de maio, o PLO 2692025, com teor semelhante às propostas estaduais. A matéria também propõe sanção administrativa para quem utilizar bonecas do tipo bebê reborn ou artifícios similares com a intenção de se beneficiar da prioridade destinada a pessoas com crianças de colo. Além disso, o projeto veta expressamente o atendimento a essas bonecas em unidades de saúde municipais, buscando garantir que a estrutura pública seja voltada exclusivamente a crianças reais. Na Câmara Municipal de Campina Grande, o vereador Sargento Wellington Cobra PSB apresentou o PL 5292025, também em 21 de maio. A proposta proíbe o uso dos bonecos sintéticos conhecidos como bebês reborn para obter prioridade em hospitais, UPAs, repartições públicas e até estabelecimentos comerciais. O projeto pretende coibir práticas que, segundo o autor, têm se tornado frequentes e comprometem o funcionamento dos serviços públicos. Até o momento, não há informações sobre o número de ocorrências oficiais envolvendo o uso de bebês reborn para burlar filas, mas os parlamentares apontam que o assunto vem ganhando notoriedade nas redes sociais e gerado preocupação entre profissionais de atendimento. As leis deverão estipular mecanismos de fiscalização e penalidades para coibir a prática em todo o estado e nas cidades de João Pessoa e Campina Grande.

Grão ficou 80 mais caro e teve maior inflação em 30 anos. Café filtrado, ou de coador, é um dos métodos mais tradicionais no Brasil e vem ganhando popularidade no exterior. Freepik O consumo de café no Brasil caiu quase 16 em abril, em relação a igual mês de 2024, em meio à disparada de preços, mostram dados divulgados pela Associação Brasileira da Indústria de café ABIC, nesta quinta-feira 22. O café ficou 80 mais caro em 12 meses até abril para o brasileiro, a maior inflação em 30 anos, segundo o IBGE. No acumulado do ano, entre janeiro e abril, as vendas do grão caíram 5,13, em relação ao mesmo período de 2024, para 4,7 milhões de sacas de 60 quilos. Os dados da ABIC são referentes às vendas do varejo, que representam de 73 a 78 do consumo interno. Dentre os tipos de café, o solúvel foi o que mais encareceu em abril, na comparação com o mesmo mês de 2024. O levantamento da Abic mostra as seguintes altas de preço no período Café solúvel 85 Gourmet 56 TradicionalExtraforte 50 Especial 42,3 Superior 29. Por que o preço subiu? Em fevereiro, a Abic já havia alertado que os preços iam continuar subindo nos dois meses seguintes porque a indústria ainda não havia repassado todo o custo da compra de café em grão. Confira abaixo alguns fatores que prejudicaram a produção e elevaram os preços do café, segundo especialistas ouvidos pelo g1. Calor e seca no ano passado, o clima gerou um estresse na planta, que, para sobreviver, precisou abortar os frutos, ou seja, impedir o seu desenvolvimento. Mas problemas, como geadas e ondas de calor, vêm acontecendo há 4 anos no Brasil. No período, a indústria teve um aumento de custos de 224 com matéria-prima e, para os consumidores, o café ficou 110 mais caro. Queda de oferta global grandes produtores, como o Vietnã, enfrentaram problemas climáticos e sofreram quebra de safra. Maior custo de logística as guerras no Oriente Médio encareceram o embarque do café nas vendas internacionais, elevando também o preço dos contêineres, principal meio para a exportação. Aumento do consumo o café é a segunda bebida mais consumida no Brasil e no mundo, atrás apenas da água. Os produtores brasileiros têm aberto espaço em novos mercados internacionais, o que influencia na oferta da bebida internamente.

Pinhão verde é tóxico à saúde e pode causar problemas no sistema digestivo veja riscos do consumo,"Total de apreensões de pinhão imaturo cresceram no Paraná em 2025. Veja dicas de como escolher pinhão bom para consumo. Pinhões estavam esbranquiçados Polícia Militar Ambiental Quando o pinhão está verde, ou seja, ainda não atingiu a maturação completa, além de não ter o gosto característico da iguaria, pode ser tóxico e causar riscos à saúde. O alerta é do Instituto Ambiental do Paraná IAT, que determina, em legislação, regras para a colheita da semente no estado, e da Polícia Militar Ambiental, que fiscaliza a comercialização da produção e registrou aumento no total de apreensões do item em 2025. Saiba mais abaixo.  Siga o canal do g1 PR no WhatsApp  Siga o canal do g1 PR no Telegram Segundo o IAT, as pinhas imaturas apresentam casca esbranquiçada e alto teor de umidade, o que favorece a presença de fungos - tornando o alimento até tóxico para o consumo humano. Conforme explica Rusllan Ribeiro, médico do Serviço de Atendimento Móvel de Urgência Samu, os pinhões verdes podem causar alterações nos hábitos intestinais. A gastroenterologista Jéssica Ribeiro complementa que o consumo não gera nenhuma doença específica, mas reforça que pode provocar diversos sintomas gastrointestinais transitórios. No pinhão imaturo, os taninos e outros compostos fenólicos estão mais concentrados. Quando consumidos em excesso, esses compostos podem causar náusea, desconfortos abdominais, constipação, má digestão e até dificultar a absorção de nutrientes, explica a médica. Navegue por esta reportagem Como escolher pinhão bom para consumo O que diz a lei sobre a colheita de pinhão Fiscalização no Paraná Pinhões estavam esbranquiçados Polícia Ambiental Como escolher pinhão bom para consumo Entre as dicas para escolher pinhão bom para consumo, estão optar pelos que têm a casca mais brilhante, com vários tons de marrom e sem furos. Em contrapartida, pinhões manchados podem estar estragados. A semente também precisa estar firme para ser considerada um bom pinhão. Na hora de cozinhar, há dicas mais específicas, como o teste da flutuação. Se quando cozinhar ele ficar na parte de cima da panela, é sinal que está estragado. Os pinhões que ficarem com a ponta para baixo também são duvidosos e devem ser retirados da panela, porque podem conter de 20 a 25 de semente brocada, ou seja, degradada na parte interna por conta da ação de larvas de mariposas, que se alimentam do pinhão e estragam o sabor. Pinhão tem versatilidade gastronômica veja receitas No Paraná, safra de pinhão vai de abril a junho Mauro ScharnikIAT O que diz a lei sobre a colheita de pinhão no Paraná A Polícia Ambiental do Paraná destaca que a colheita, o armazenamento e a comercialização de pinhas imaturas são proibidos. No estado, as normas e instruções de comercialização do pinhão são estabelecidas na Portaria IAP nº 0462015, que diz que só podem ser colhidos pinhões de pinhas que apresentarem características de maturação, estado deiscente com coloração verde-amarelada ou marrom típica. O texto também fixa a data de 1º de abril para início da colheita, transporte, comercialização e armazenamento do pinhão e proíbe o abate de pinheiros adultos Araucaria angustifolia, portadores de pinhas, na época de queda de sementes - ou seja, nos meses de abril, maio e junho -, exceto quando autorizado. A multa em caso de desobediência é de R 300 a cada 50 quilos de pinhão apreendidos, além da responsabilização por crime ambiental. As justificativas vão desde manter as sementes para proteger a espécie da árvore e a alimentação de animais, até garantir a saúde dos consumidores. Por isso, devido a aspectos técnicos, no Paraná a safra vai de abril até junho, e não é permitida a venda de pinhões trazidos de outros estados. No Paraná, safra de pinhão vai de abril a junho Mauro ScharnikIAT Fiscalização no Paraná A fiscalização do comércio de pinhão no Paraná é feita pelos agentes do IAT e pelo Batalhão de Polícia Ambiental-Força Verde BPAmb-FV. Denúncias podem ser encaminhadas à Ouvidoria do IAT, aos escritórios regionais, pelos telefones 41 3213-3466 e 41 3213-3873 ou 0800-643-0304 e, ainda, à Polícia Ambiental 41 3299-1350. De acordo com a polícia, até meados do mês de maio mais de 330 quilos de pinhão verde foram apreendidos no estado em 2025 - cerca de 20 vezes a mais do que no ano anterior. Para a corporação, o aumento expressivo se deve ao aumento na fiscalização e também no número de denúncias recebidas pelo órgão.

LEIA TAMBÉM Policial é preso por roubar dinheiro, joias e caixas de whisky da casa de idosos em Mossoró veja vídeo Idosos ficaram trancados por três horas Crime aconteceu na madrugada de terça 20. Reprodução O crime ocorreu na madrugada de terça-feira 20, por volta das 3h, quando três homens encapuzados e armados invadiram a casa do casal de idosos no Bairro Alto do Sumaré, em Mossoró. Durante a ação, os criminosos trancaram as vítimas em um closet, sob ameaça. As vítimas só conseguiram sair do cômodo por volta das 6h, quando a empregada doméstica chegou à residência. Carro em oficina Idosos tiveram casa arrombada e foram roubados por policial militar, em Mossoró. InterTV Segundo a Polícia Civil do Rio Grande do Norte, com o auxílio de imagens de câmeras de segurança o agentes da Delegacia Especializada em Furtos e Roubos DEFUR de Mossoró identificaram que o carro utilizado pelos criminosos pertencia ao policial. Quando abordado, Diogo Ádamo afirmou que o veículo utilizado no crime estava em uma oficina desde o dia 18 de maio. No entanto, a versão foi desmentida pelo proprietário da oficina, que confirmou que o carro havia sido deixado no local na manhã seguinte ao roubo. Durante as investigações, os policiais encontraram uma caixa de whisky em frente à residência do suspeito e outra garrafa no porta-malas do veículo. As vítimas reconheceram os itens como sendo os mesmos roubados durante a ação criminosa. A arma de fogo do policial também foi apreendida. Defesa alega prisão sem fundamento A defesa de Diogo Ádamo, feita pelo advogado Antônio Douglas de Sousa Pereira, disse que a prisão do agente foi ilegal e sem fundamento sólido. Ele foi detido aproximadamente nove horas após o suposto crime, sem ter sido reconhecido por vítimas, sem flagrante e sem portar qualquer item relacionado ao delito. A abordagem inicial da PM ocorreu antes do registro de boletim de ocorrência, e nada irregular foi encontrado, disse a defesa. Ainda conforme o advogado, a caixa de whisky encontrada em frente à residência do policial e um amassado no carro dele não seriam provas suficientes para ocasionar a prisão. Ele foi preso por volta do meio-dia, com base apenas em um amassado em seu veículo, semelhante a outros existentes na cidade, e por uma caixa vazia de whisky da marca Old Parr  considerada comum e amplamente vendida. Há uma tentativa de associar o whisky encontrado em frente à casa do policial ao crime, sem provas técnicas ou reconhecimento formal. Por fim, a defesa alega que a prisão foi baseada apenas em suposição e coincidências genéricas. Não há placa identificada, testemunhos, confissão, ou qualquer evidência concreta ligando o policial ao fato, afirmou a defesa do PM.
