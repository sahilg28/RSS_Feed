What would Russias peace deal demands really mean for Ukraine?  visualised,"Trump on Monday again failed to persuade Putin to accept a ceasefire in Ukraine as a first step toward a peace deal. But what might a deal even look like, and what would it mean for the Ukrainian people?One of the few explicit peace proposals is a US outline reportedly seen by Reuters last month. It asks Ukraine to accept de jure recognition of Russias annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of its occupation of large parts of several oblasts in the countrys east. On Monday, Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that Russia is demanding Ukrainian troops abandon five oblasts as a precondition not for peace, but for a ceasefire and the opening of negotiations.Before the war, those oblasts were home to about 11 million Ukrainians. To put that into context, we visualised some broadly comparable populated areas in three European countries and one US state, in each case starting from the north-east corner. The shaded areas represent populations of about 11 million French, British, Italian and US citizens.

Breath-stoppingly tense which Mission Impossible film is the greatest?,"As The Final Reckoning hits cinemas, Guardian writers pick their favourites of the action-packed seriesMission Impossibles slick and sensuous surface bears no trace of the drama behind the scenes making it. During production, the screenwriters of Jurassic Park David Koepp and Chinatown Robert Towne sent in duelling script pages for director Brian De Palma and producer Tom Cruise to wrestle over. The magnificent outcome is an intense tango between the modern blockbuster and a classic film noir, circling each other warily, and beautifully, like no Mission Impossible that would follow. De Palmas original is a sexy wrong-man thriller, a Hitchcockian affair that comes disguised as an action-heavy corporate product or maybe the mask is worn the other way around?. In it, Cruises coiled IMF agent, framed for the murder of his entire team and surrounded by slippery allies, is constantly trying to play it cool through the plots knotty parlor games, all while feeling the noose tightening around him. If Cruises career up to this point was all about often leaving his relaxed boyish middle-American charm on the surface, Mission Impossible pushed him to try on layers  not just the latex ones  while also pulling off those incredible high-wire stunts, which would only escalate but never improve on the hair-raising tension the first time out.

A few years ago, they say, the market would have been bustling with ice-cream sellers, salt vendors and horse-drawn carts delivering freshly caught fish to the women, who would set about sun-drying, salting and sorting the catch into affordable portions for local families to buy.Today, trade is dead, says Aissatou Wade, one of the remaining small-scale fish processors left in the town.

HighPriest1967Paul is an extraordinary director, a visionary director, and I absorbed so much by watching him work. He comes from documentary, so even though he was filming these elaborate, very expensive, complicated action sequences, he was still able to see things happening spontaneously. I remember when we were shooting The Bourne Ultimatum in Tangier, running through those windy streets. Normally as an actor, you turn a corner and you think youre off camera, so youd stop. But you could never do that with Paul because there might be a camera around the corner. He always liked to keep us on our toes.You stole the show as Heather Grahams sister in Chosen Family. Is it easier to approach comedic, unpredictable roles as opposed to more intense, serious, Bourne-like performances? BicuserI absolutely love working on comedies.

The Crucible review  Millers resonant tale of terror given radical sense of humour,"Shakespeares Globe, LondonDirector Ola Ince brings absurdist comedy to Arthur Millers classic drama of Salem witch-hunting, now told partly through songThere is never a time when Arthur Millers play about a world turned upside down by collective hysteria and scapegoating does not bear some resonance. But the present moment  of dangerously disputed truths and lies  is an especially pertinent moment to revisit Millers analogy between accusations of witchcraft and McCarthyist terror.This production is faithful to the original 17th-century setting, amid the heat and panic of the Salem witch trials. There is period dress bonnets for women, pointed hats for men and ribbons for the judges, along with a range of broad British accents for these original American pilgrims. But director Ola Ince brings a quietly radical touch in the form of humour  more absurdist than comic, with accusations of flying girls and demon possession taking on preposterous tones. The men, mostly the judges of the last two acts, appear bumbling, like yokels arguing over the fate of their chattel at a country fair. Deputy Governor Danforth Gareth Snook is particularly clownish, though no less awful for it.

Extremely loud and incredibly scouse how Jamie Carragher conquered football punditry,"Football coverage no longer stops after the final whistle. And in this new era, the former Liverpool defender reigns supremeJamie Carraghers legs were aching. He had been speaking to a Sky Sports cameraman for 25 minutes.

Reports were coming out that Trent Alexander-Arnold, who inherited Carraghers mantle as the local mainstay of Liverpools defence, was about to announce his long-expected departure from his boyhood club, and so, as sure as day follows night, a camera crew had been hastily dispatched to Carraghers whereabouts to find a quiet spot, hit record and get his opinions out to viewers before theyd had a chance to fully form their own.How much was there to say about a subject that had already been talked about all season long? Quite a lot, it turned out. Like a hunter-gatherer extracting a weeks worth of food from a seemingly arid wilderness, Carragher  occasionally prompted by a Sky Sports anchor in the studio  launched into nearly half an hour of pure, free-flowing, agenda-setting football opinionating. From this monologue, Sky would carve out a TV report, YouTube interview, news article and three short-form videos. When Carragher says something  about Alexander-Arnolds future, Arsenals attack, Chelseas owners or Fifas executives  we tend to hear about it very shortly after.

Ive studied the history of death. I know how we can better face up to our grief  and our own mortality  Molly Conisbee,"How we deal with bereavement has changed enormously over the years. But not all the old traditions should be forgottenMany years ago, as part of a school homework project, I asked my grandparents what the most significant social change had been during their lifetime. Two of them answered child mortality. I was surprised. Werent there other, more significant experiences in long lives that had stretched from the first and second world wars to the 1980s?But now that I am older and have experienced bereavement, I understand their replies. Both grandparents had sisters who died of diphtheria. And my grandfathers younger brother died of sepsis, meaning his parents had buried two of their four children before the age of three. Their childhoods had been profoundly shaped by loss. Child mortality was, at that time, horrifyingly common, and from their earliest years many people spent a great deal of their lives coping with the emotional fallout of grief, which shaped their lives into older age.Molly Conisbee is a social historian, visiting research fellow at the Centre for Death and Society at the University of Bath, and author of No Ordinary Deaths Continue reading...",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/22/i-have-studied-history-of-death-better-face-grief-mortality,2025-05-22T09:00:00,The Guardian,UK,en

"If aid doesnt enter Gaza now, 14,000 babies may die. UN peacekeepers must step in  Michael Fakhri","As a UN special rapporteur on the right to food, I have watched for 19 months as Israel starves children. The world must act nowOn Monday, Israel launched an intensive ground offensive named Operation Gideons Chariots as part of its plan to cause as much pain and damage as possible to everyone in Gaza. Israel has announced its intent to gain full indefinite control over Gaza, in effect aiming for annexation. This was after the international court of justice found Israels occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and demanded it end its occupation as rapidly as possible and provide full reparations to Palestinians.Israels increased violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory also comes after it denied all food, water and supplies from entering Gaza for over 75 days. In March, child acute malnutrition increased by more than 80. The price of wheat flour has increased by 3,000 since February.

The Guardian view on Russia sanctions a brittle economy is Putins weakness  Editorial,"Ukraines allies must dial up sanctions to expose the fragility of the Kremlins strategy for perpetual warDonald Trumps pledge to end the war in Ukraine on the first day of his second term as US president was a sign of his unsuitability as a peace broker. A clearer sign was his apparent sympathy with Vladimir Putin. Mr Trumps tone regarding the Russian president has cooled somewhat on the discovery that the conflict cannot be frozen by White House diktat. There are hints of recognition that the peace process is failing because the Kremlin is cynically playing for time. Sadly, any such insight hasnt evolved into outrage at the criminal aggression that started the war in the first place.Accounts of a telephone call between the two leaders earlier this week indicate no increase in American pressure on Russia. Mr Trumps impatience with the whole issue seems likelier to result in him walking away. Mr Putin relishes that prospect.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian view on social cohesion too many of us are still bowling alone  Editorial,"Three decades on from Robert Putnams account of fraying social ties in the US, new research in Britain identifies similar dangersThirty years after writing Bowling Alone, the famous essay in which he diagnosed a dangerous crisis of social cohesion in the United States, Robert Putnam has a right to feel vindicated. In a lecture this spring, Prof Putnam, now 84, warned his audience that, amid levels of polarisation and distrust higher than at any time since the civil war, the US was in danger of going to hell in a handcart.Britain is still, thankfully, a long way from the poisonous toxicity of Trump-era America, notwithstanding the ominous rise of Reform and Nigel Farage. But research published this week by the More in Common polling group paints a worrying portrait of communities in which there is a widespread sense of social disconnection, high levels of distrust among the young and a felt loss of shared spaces and rituals.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Very heavy, very heavy, he said. The Spurs captain had accidentally head-butted it as he hoisted it high into the sky after the 1-0 win over Manchester United, a teammate having pushed into him as he performed the move he had dreamed about ever since signing from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015.

I struggled with the lifestyle former teen prodigy Amanda Anisimova on her career-saving break,"As she returns to the French Open, where she broke through in a run to the 2019 semis, the American explains why she stepped away from the sportProfessional tennis players are often led to believe that taking time off is fatal. In such an intense, competitive individual sport where greatness is determined though fine margins, the pressure to keep on moving is eternal. If you are not constantly training, competing and working on your craft, it is said, someone will always be there to take your place. Once you lose your spot, you may never get it back.During the most difficult period of her career, Amanda Anisimova, a former teen prodigy, had to reckon with that myth. In the depths of her depression, when the intensity of the tennis circuit had become unbearable and her mind was screaming out for change, the 23-year-old opted for the solution of a complete break from the sport two years ago.

Im less apologetic now Kelly Macdonald on her Trainspotting teen highs and hitting her stride in her 40s,"She hid in the toilets during the Trainspotting shoot  yet became a screen sensation. As the star plays a police therapist in new Netflix thriller Dept Q, she explains why todays young female actors leave her in aweOne of the good things about playing a therapist, says Kelly Macdonald with a laugh, is that you get to sit down a lot. Theres a fun scene in the new Netflix thriller Dept. Q in which her character, Dr Rachel Irving, weary of her client DCI Carl Morck, plants herself down behind her desk to eat her packed lunch in front of him. Morck may be the kind of troubled detective were used to seeing in police dramas, but Irving isnt a typical therapist. Shes blunt, antagonistic even. Its a shitty job working with police officers, she tells him. Another time she describes him as doolally, which in my experience is not something a typical therapist would say Macdonald, who has had therapy, but not regularly, may agree.In the show  adapted from novels by the Danish author Jussi Adler-Olsen and brought to the screen by Scott Frank, who was also behind the Netflix hit The Queens Gambit  Morck is made to see Irving after he survives a shooting. Brilliant but sidelined, Morck is tasked with reviewing cold cases, and moved to a shabby basement office that becomes known as Department Q. The first case for his small crew of misfit detectives is the disappearance of a lawyer four years earlier, who everyone thinks is probably dead. The truth, it soon emerges, is absolutely terrifying.

"Yes review  a fierce satire of Israels ruling classes, radioactive with political pain","Cannes film festivalNadav Lapids brilliant, showy set-pieces present a caricature of decadence and heartlessness in a society haunted by 7 OctoberNadav Lapids Yes is a fierce, stylised, confrontational caricature-satire that invites a comparison with George Grosz, dialled up to 11 in its sexualised choreography and almost radioactive with political pain. With icy provocation, Israels ruling classes are presented as decadent and indifferent to the slaughter and suffering of Gaza. But the film is also in some ways a sympathetic study of a people haunted by the antisemitic butchery of 7 October.It is inspired by the activist group Civic Front, which after 7 October released a new version of Haim Gouris classic song Hareut, or Fellowship, with jarring new lyrics calling for wholesale extermination in Gaza. A fictional version of this song features here, with lyrics about attacking the bearers of the swastika as in the original but also presents its audience with slick equivalence the Nazi gotcha-comparison is levelled at Israel in a way that it isnt at other countries. There is an odious Russian fintech bro here, commissioning jingoistic, nationalistic music the suggested equivalence between Putin and Israel is presented without subtlety, although subtlety is maybe beside the point.

Plus, constant surveillance by hidden cameras feeding private information back to Masha at all times. Let me stop you there and say  well, yes, quite.

The Salt Path by Raynor Winn audiobook review  a life-changing journey,"Facing homelessness and incurable illness, a couple sets out on a 630-mile hike in this lyrical memoir read by the authorA few days after Raynor Winn and her husband, Moth, had their Welsh farm repossessed owing to a failed investment, Moth learned he had a rare and incurable neurodegenerative condition. With their world upended and nowhere to live, the couple decided there was only one course of action to walk.Their plan was to follow the South West Coast Path, a hiking trail taking them from Minehead in Somerset, along the northern coasts of Devon and Cornwall, around Lands End and Lizard Point, then back along Cornwalls south coast, south Devon and ending in Poole in Dorset. The 630-mile walk, taking in secluded beaches and coves, wild moorland and quiet hamlets and coastal towns, is equivalent to climbing Mount Everest four times over.

Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No 3 album review  hear the performance that made Yunchan Lim a star,"Yunchan LimFort Worth SOAlsopDeccaThe prodigious South Korean talent won 2022s Van Cliburn piano competition with this performance his version deserves a place alongside Argerich and Rachmaninov himselfAs soon as the 2022 Van Cliburn piano competition in Fort Worth, Texas, was over, news travelled across the Atlantic that the latest winner was very special indeed. Over the following year or so, Yunchan Lims recitals in Europe and a first disc for Decca of the Chopin Études, together with recordings that documented his performances in the competition, of Liszts Transcendental Études in his semi-final recital, and Rachmaninovs Third Concerto in the final, confirmed that the reports had been no exaggeration he is the real thing, a once-in-a-generation talent. Now Decca has reissued the Fort Worth concerto performance, but with the sound significantly cleaned up and rebalanced, and the wonder of Lims playing if anything enhanced. What is immediately striking is the sheer confidence and poise of everything he does, and the overriding sense that there is never any doubt about the direction in which this majestic concerto should be taken its hard to believe that this is the performance of an 18-year-old.Needless to say, every technical challenge in the keyboard writing seems to be effortlessly negotiated, yet the brilliance is never an end in itself it is always part of a bigger picture, without ever diminishing the thrill of such astonishing command, so that the way the unadorned melodic lines of the slow movement are phrased becomes just as telling as the way in which the densest flurries of notes are negotiated. Just perhaps in the finale, when Lim can seem too headstrong for his own good, does his performance betray his age otherwise it deserves a place alongside the finest versions of this concerto on disc, from those by Rachmaninov himself and Vladimir Horowitz to Martha Argerich and Vladimir Ashkenazy. Despite Deccas remastering, though, the sound is by no means perfect some orchestral detail remains too distant, and the string sound is sometimes scrawny and undernourished. Normally such shortcomings might preclude a five-star recommendation, but Lims playing is so astonishing its almost irrelevant.

No Straight Road Takes You There by Rebecca Solnit review  an activists antidote to despair,"Hope is no casual platitude in this inspiring collection of essays its the realistic mindset with which to approach existential challengesAccording to Rebecca Solnit, a lot of us are suffering from something called moral injury. She describes this as the deep sense of wrongness that can infiltrate our lives when we realise we are complicit in something seriously bad.The first time I experienced this in relation to climate change, I was changing my babys nappy soon after one of the worst Australian wildfire seasons on record in 2020. The nappy featured a smiling cartoon koala on the front. I immediately recalled the scene of a singed, parched koala being fed water from a plastic bottle by a human as it fled the inferno. A disposable nappy takes up to 500 years to decompose. I felt disgust and despair at the degree of consumption, waste and exploitation that even a modest lifestyle in a high-income country seems to entail.

My husband and I had two children and lost them both, she writes, and words can only fall short.She begins by laying out the facts. And those facts, raw and precise, are shattering Vincent died in 2017, aged 16. James died in 2024, aged 19. Vincent, we learn, loved baking and knitting, and did not live long enough to graduate high school. James, a brilliant linguist studying at Princeton, where Li teaches creative writing, took his last Japanese class on a Friday.

The Book of Guilt by Catherine Chidgey review  this dystopia could have been extraordinary,"Alternate political realities are compellingly explored in this sinister vision of a childrens home  but the echoes of Ishiguro are just too strongIn 2016 Catherine Chidgey published her fourth novel, The Wish Child, a childs-eye view of Nazi Germany. Since then the much-garlanded New Zealander has contrived to be not only conspicuously prolific but also intriguingly unpredictable. Though she returned to wartime Germany in her Womens prize-longlisted Holocaust novel, Remote Sympathy, her work has ranged from the coming-of-age psychological thriller Pet to The Beat of the Pendulum, a found novel that drew on everything from conversations and social media posts to news bulletins and even satnav instructions to create a picture of one womans life over a year. The Axemans Carnival, published in the UK last year, was partly narrated by a magpie. Like The Wish Child it won the Acorn prize for fiction, making Chidgey the only writer to win New Zealands most prestigious prize twice.The Book of Guilt appears to mark another departure. Chidgey describes her ninth novel as her first foray into dystopian fiction and, while the book purports to be set in England in 1979 with a female prime minister newly ensconced in Downing Street, it is not the country we know. In Chidgeys alternate universe, the second world war ended not in 1945 with allied victory, but in 1943 when the assassination of Hitler by German conspirators led to a swiftly negotiated peace treaty. Subsequent collaboration across Europe has ensured that progress in biological and medical science, already significantly advanced, has accelerated, fuelled by shared research that includes the grotesque experiments carried out on prisoners in Nazi death camps.

Deliver at All Costs review  madcap driving game goes nowhere fast,"PC, Xbox, PS5 version played Studio Far Out GamesKonami Digital EntertainmentThis 1950s-set game offers a gorgeous, fully destroyable map but makes baffling decisions on how to use itDeliver at All Costs casts you as a delivery driver in the late 1950s, and it looks fantastic in motion. Almost everything on the map can be destroyed, and there is immediate fun to be had from causing merry mayhem with your truck, clattering through deckchairs on the beach or driving straight through the middle of a diner and watching it collapse spectacularly behind you. But there is a void at the heart of this game where the core hook should have been.We get a glimpse of its potential during a mission that sees you racing to catch up with a rivals delivery truck before it can reach its destination. The aim is to manoeuvre alongside, and hold down a button so the crane on the back of your own truck can sneakily lift the package off their vehicle and on to yours. All the while, rival trucks are attempting to ram you off the road, and after you grab the package, you then have to deliver it while fending off the attentions of these other drivers. It leads to some wonderfully comic scenes in which a hotel owner thanks you profusely for a consignment while standing in front of the ruins of his newly destroyed establishment a casualty of the violent act of delivery.

Although a few titles were still being released for the machine in 1995, the games magazine world had moved on and all anyone wanted to read about were the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It was a bitter blow.Fast-forward to 2025 and a resurgent interest in producing new games for vintage home computers and consoles has led to Farming Simulator 16bit Edition  a Mega Drive instalment in the hugely successful agricultural sim series.

"Hockney in London review  hip, horny but still searching for his own style","Hazlitt Holland-Hibbert, LondonBefore he made a bigger splash, David Hockney was an angry, tempestuous student mashing together the styles of the big artists of his timeYears before he was a modern art megastar, long before the cool pop perfection that would make him one of the most popular painters of the past century, David Hockney was a student. Some of his early works from this period have been brought together at a small but perfectly formed exhibition, curated by Louis Kasmin, grandson of John Kasmin, the dealer who first spotted Hockney.After leaving the Bradford School of Art, Hockney showed up at the RCA in 1959 ready to kick the art worlds doors in. But this is not the Hockney the world knows now. There is no simplicity, no calm. There are no cool, flat planes of bright colour. Rather, young Hockney was a frantic, angry, tempestuous thing.

Anyone fancy a subwoofer massage? The show that shakes you senseless,"From vibrating stages and a car park dance floor to metal pipes tuned to the frequency of love, the artists behind a new exhibition say their work may even change your body on a cellular levelYou know, 528Hz is supposed to be the love frequency, says artist Evan Ifekoya, striking a metal wah-wah pipe tuned to exactly that pitch, a fraction above the C, one octave higher than middle C. Its supposed to be able to transform the body on a cellular level. And, OK, how can you really prove that? they smile. But I can say, at least for myself, it has opened up a new level of awareness and self-compassion over the years. We know music is powerful we turn to songs to feel comforted, to boost our energy, to appreciate beauty and so much more. But what about the frequencies the actual soundwaves vibrating the air, our eardrums and our bodies  how do they affect us? From promoting deep relaxation to the use of noise as a weapon, there is a wide range of claims, and evidence, for the impact of sound. It moves us emotionally and literally, a theme thats explored in a new exhibition at the Barbican in London called Feel the Sound. The idea that the world is made up of vibrations and frequencies is something we dont necessarily think about a lot of the time, says Luke Kemp, head of creative programming at Barbican Immersive. The big idea is how sound is more than an audio experience. We can think of our whole body as a listening device, he says.Take Jan St Werners Vibraceptional Plate installation, which visitors can stand on and then explore the resonance of their own body, and a film by deaf percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie discussing the rhythms inside us and how she experiences sound. Theres a holographic choral experience, a playground of multisensory musical instruments, and for the finale, an installation in the Barbicans car park featuring souped-up cars with big sound systems part sculpture, part dancefloor.

Theres plenty to love about this US import, a country musical with a zany corn obsession and a message about breaking down barriers that suits this open air theatre. But just how much corn-fed wordplay can you stomach? Youll soon find out. Theres a maze of maize jokes, some kernels of truth amid the cornball sentiment, a husk of a plot about a corn doctor mistakenly assumed to treat ears not feet and a few painful gags about cornholes.

Customers are very likely to have spotted the millefoglie long before seeing it typed up on the paper menu, though, because it will be sitting near the front door, either on the dessert trolley or zinc bar.Named because the concertina puff of the pastry looks like a thousand mille leaves foglie, La Torricella prepares a millefoglie that is more or less the size of a vinyl LP, its three rings of pastry sandwiched with a mixture of custard and whipped cream, otherwise known as diplomat cream. The layers of preparation make it a special-occasion dessert  in fact, La Torricella makes millefoglie only when a large enough group requests one. The rest of the room, however, then benefits from someone elses celebration, because the kitchen might as well make two while theyre at it. Or at least I think thats how it works.

Im taking beta blockers for my anxiety  and so are many of my friends. Is that a problem?,"Dreading the thought of giving a speech, or stressed about a big work event? Your GP may prescribe beta blockers to reduce the effects of adrenaline on your heart. Heres what happened when I took themI first took beta blockers two years ago, when I was asked to give a eulogy. Terrible at public speaking on a good day, let alone at a funeral, my first instinct was to refuse to do it. I had made a speech at a friends wedding 15 years before and my legs shook so violently throughout that I thought I would collapse. This isnt a case of being overcritical or dramatic I find it almost impossible to stand up in front of a crowd and talk. It is an ordeal, for all involved  or it was before I took beta blockers.Beta blockers are a prescription medication that blocks adrenaline and therefore temporarily reduces the bodys reaction to stress. Routinely given to patients with heart and circulatory conditions, including angina, atrial fibrillation and high blood pressure, as well as to prevent migraines, they are also prescribed for some kinds of anxiety. Some doctors will suggest taking them regularly, at certain times of the day. Others will suggest taking a specified dose when you feel you need it. They work by reducing the effects of adrenaline on the heart, so you dont get that heart-racing feeling, you may not get short of breath or sweaty, and they can reduce the symptoms of a full-blown panic attack, says doctor and broadcaster Amir Khan, who has been a GP in Bradford for 16 years.

Not chalk and cheese, but perhaps a bit like salt-and-vinegar and cheese-and-onion. Just different flavours.A stripe is brisker, while a spot is giving whimsy.

Those of us with oily skin, an active lifestyle or a hormonal propensity for sweating or flushing, can also struggle to hold on to foundation, eyeshadow and more. But until recently, the term long-wear often meant dry, dragging, somewhat joyless textures and shades.My best new discovery is Milks superlative Hydro Grip Gel Tint 34, available in 15 shades I wear number five and its perfect. Its light and comfortable texture and sheer, natural-looking, summery coverage betray what is extraordinarily dogged staying power. Used in place of foundation or tinted moisturiser, this has remained perfectly intact through tears, 16-hour days and a common cold  its glow never dimming. It has a flexible, stretchy gel texture that prevents cracking or caking as skin tires and dries. Concealer, blush, powders and anything else you care to throw on top layer over happily and smoothly it has a similar texture to a primer. Its an unequivocal 1010 and I already know itll be among my best products of 2025. For a smidge more coverage with a comparable lifespan, try Maybellines impressive Super Stay 24h Skin Tint 13.99.

Its a good question, given the beauty of our surroundings, but we soon realise that having the place to ourselves is a common occurance on our slow adventure exploring Portugals least-populated coastline.

"Winners, resigners, guest dogs and royal losers  take the Thursday quiz","Questions on general knowledge and topical trivia, plus a few jokes, every Thursday. How will you fare?The Thursday quiz was listening to Hello by The Beloved the other day, in the hope of asking a question such as how many people mentioned in the song are still alive and getting the in-joke answer 30-50. But it soon realised it was going to be quibbles all the way down. Leslie Crowther? Died in 1996. Kym Mazelle? Still very much with us. But Zippy? Well, Roy Skelton, who voiced him and the Daleks died in 2011. But is Zippy dead? Or was Zippy ever alive? What about the LSO? Presumably some of the people playing in the LSO at the time the single came out in 1990 have subsequently passed. But does that count? Anyway, one thing we can all agree on, that was certainly some words to bulk out this article page so it gets indexed by search engines. On with the quiz  15 questions, no prizes, have fun!The Thursday quiz, No 211 Continue reading...",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/may/22/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-211,2025-05-22T10:00:47,The Guardian,UK,en
A moment that changed me I thought Id never fit in in rural France  until a revelation at the boulangerie,"Id spent 10 years trying to be more like my goat-farming neighbours. What if I stressed my Britishness instead?I was standing in the long queue of a rural French boulangerie when it happened. The sun was just coming up and the glorious smell of freshly baked baguette filled the dawn air. I drank it in and shuffled forward, awaiting my turn, aware I was getting looks  and it wasnt difficult to see why. I had driven all night from performing at a comedy gig in London to get to my home in the Loire valley, and I was still in my work clothes. My stage wear included a check tweed Edwardian frock coat with matching weskit, navy blue dress trousers, brogue monk shoes, a smart Oxford-collared shirt and a knitted blue tie, slightly loosened. Under normal circumstances, I would not invade my local boulangerie dressed as a cross between a late 60s dandy and a roaring 20s duellist, but it had been a long drive, and I was too tired to tone it down.Plus, I had never really fit in locally anyway. We had moved there about 10 years earlier, in 2005  a catastrophic decision, according to my agent, but a happy one for me, my wife and our then four-year-old son the pace of life was less frenetic and we felt less hemmed in. And, as I often said only half-jokingly, it was the closest place to London we could afford to buy a house. Things had gone pretty well my wife, being half-French and fluent, was working locally as a teacher, and my son had picked up the language more quickly than I can change a car tyre. We had two more children and I was  well, I was doing OK.

Texas model cuts costs and prison numbers  Letters,"Maurice Vanstone, Anita Kalunta-Crumpton and Philip Priestley on a promising form of prison reform, and James Stoddart on the causes of crimeWe welcome Gaby Hinsliffs call for a more enlightened approach to cutting crime Republican Texas is a surprising model for solving the UKs prison crisis  but it just might work, 16 May. To achieve this and deal with the problem of prison overcrowding, we do not need to build more prisons. Community sentences require more resources so they can constructively challenge offending behaviour while keeping convicted individuals in touch with their responsibilities to families and communities.For those in prison, this would also allow for the application of the Texas model  a promising form of prison reform that is not only cost-saving but has also reduced crime and recidivism rates in that state. Its success lies significantly in prioritising incarceration for violent offences.
