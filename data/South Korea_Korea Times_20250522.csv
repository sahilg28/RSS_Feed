"US House passes Trumps sweeping tax-cut bill, sends on to Senate","WASHINGTON - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a sweeping tax and spending bill that would enact much of President Donald Trumps policy agenda on Thursday and saddle the country with trillions of dollars in debt. The bill would fulfill many of Trumps populist campaign pledges, delivering new tax breaks on tips and car loans and boosting spending on the military and border enforcement. It will add about 3.8 trillion to the federal governments 36.2 trillion in debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. What Trump called the one, big, beautiful bill passed in a 215-214 vote, with all of the chambers Democrats and two Republicans voting against it. A third Republican voted present. The package must also win approval in the Republican-controlled Senate before Trump can sign it into law. The vote came after a marathon push that kept lawmakers debating the bill through two successive nights. The 1,000-page legislation would extend corporate and individual tax cuts passed in 2017 during Trumps first term i",https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/world/20250522/us-house-passes-trumps-sweeping-tax-cut-bill-sends-on-to-senate?utm_source=rss,2025-05-22T14:47:03,Korea Times,South Korea,en
Kremlin says no agreement yet on Vatican peace talks,"MOSCOW  The Kremlin said Thursday it had not yet agreed to peace talks with Ukraine at the Vatican after US media reported the city-state could host a meeting soon. Russian and Ukrainian officials held their first face-to-face talks on the conflict in more than three years last week in Istanbul but did not reach an agreement on a ceasefire. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that follow-up talks between the two sides were expected to take place at the Vatican, starting mid-June, but the Kremlins spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied this. There have been no agreements on this matter, Peskov told reporters. Peskov also denied Finnish President Alexander Stubbs suggestion that technical talks could take place at the Vatican as early as next week. There are no specific agreements for the next meetings. This has yet to be agreed upon, the Kremlin spokesman said. US President Donald Trump spoke with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Monday, but neither his call nor the earlier talks in Istanbul resulted in Russia offering any concessions. Putin has repeatedly rejected proposals f",https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/world/20250522/kremlin-says-no-agreement-yet-on-vatican-peace-talks?utm_source=rss,2025-05-22T14:47:03,Korea Times,South Korea,en
"Ex-assistant tells of cleaning up booze, drugs and baby oil after Sean Diddy Combs sex marathons","NEW YORK  Sean Diddy Combs one-time personal assistant testified Wednesday that he was in charge of cleaning up hotel rooms after the hip-hop moguls sex marathons  tossing out empty alcohol bottles, baby oil and drugs, tidying pillows and making it look as if nothing had happened. An implied part of the job was that protecting him and protecting his public image were important to him, George Kaplan told jurors at Combs federal sex trafficking trial. Thats what I was keen on doing. Kaplan, who worked for Combs from 2013 to 2015, said the Bad Boy Records founder would sometimes summon him to a hotel room to deliver a medicine kit, a bag full of prescription pills and over-the-counter pain medications. He said Combs dispatched him to buy drugs including MDMA, also known as ecstasy. Kaplan, 34, was granted immunity to testify after initially telling the Manhattan court that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Prosecutors contend Combs leaned on employees and used his music and fashion empire to facilitate and cover up his",https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/world/20250522/ex-assistant-tells-of-cleaning-up-booze-drugs-and-baby-oil-after-sean-diddy-combs-sex-marathons?utm_source=rss,2025-05-22T14:47:03,Korea Times,South Korea,en

Bitcoin surges to all-time peak as crypto sentiment improves,"LONDONNEW YORK  Bitcoin rose to its highest level on record on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous high from January, as risk sentiment continues to improve after last months tariff-induced selloff. The worlds largest cryptocurrency touched a high of 109,760.08, and was last up 1.1 percent at 108,117. Its ascent was driven by a combination of factors including easing trade tension between the United States and China and Moodys downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt which has prompted investors to seek alternative investment sources to the dollar. Now that Januarys high has been surpassed  and the 50 percent upside from Aprils lows has been achieved  bitcoin enters blue sky territory with tailwinds in the form of institutional momentum and a favorable U.S. regulatory environment, Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of digital asset trading platform Nexo, said in an emailed comment.

Trump confronts South African leader with baseless claims of the systematic killing of white farmers,"WASHINGTON  President Donald Trump used a White House meeting to forcefully confront South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, accusing the country of failing to address Trumps baseless claim of the systematic killing of white farmers. Trump even dimmed the lights of the Oval Office to play a video of a far-left politician chanting a song that includes the lyrics kill the farmer. He also leafed through news articles to underscore his point, saying the countrys white farmers have faced death, death, death, horrible death. Trump had already cut all U.S. assistance to South Africa and welcomed several dozen white South African farmers to the U.S. as refugees as he pressed the case that a genocide is underway in the country . The U.S. president, since his return to office, has launched a series of accusations at South Africas Black-led government, claiming it is seizing land from white farmers, enforcing antiwhite policies and pursuing an anti-American foreign policy .

Netanyahu promises new Gaza aid delivery plan as supplies still fail to reach Palestinians,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip  The U.N. said Wednesday it was trying to get the desperately needed aid that has entered Gaza this week into the hands of Palestinians amid delays because of fears of looting and Israeli military restrictions.
